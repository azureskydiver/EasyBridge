South bids 1S.

--------------------
B00 Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Spade.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Spade contract...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
2REVAL70: Dummy's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 11.0 down to 10.5 points.
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Spade suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 18.0-25.0 points.
ROVRC99: We have insufficient strength for either a raise, suit shift, or NT bid, so pass.
We pass.

3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 5.
2REVAL18: Declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract in Clubs from 11.0 down to 10.0 points)
H50: Have 11.0/11.0/11.0 points, but have N/A support for partner's ???? suit (holding ), and don't have a good suit of our own, so just shift to 1 Club.
But our bid (1 Club) is too low vs. the last bid of of 2 Diamonds, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 Diamonds (doubled).  Declarer is East; South leads.
