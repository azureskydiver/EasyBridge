[[File Comments]]
After I opened with 2C (in a weak two system), Easy Bridge responded 2D, as expected.  When I bid 3D, Easy Bridge passed even though he had precious little D support and with 6 hearts, should've bid 3H, knowing that I could've gone to 3NT if I didn't like H.

S:96  H:AT9863  D:7  C:T732
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 4.0, Distn pts = 3.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 4.0.
  QT's = 1.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: H
  Probable Stoppers in:
  2 Likely Winners (0/3/0/-1)
  11 Likely Losers (2/3/1/5)
Playing five-card majors, Hearts can be opened.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
East passes.

South bids 2C.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Clubs.
Partner made an artificial bid of 2 Clubs, showing either a game suit or 20+ points.  We want to respond positively if interested in a slam.
With only 4.0/4.0 points, we deny interest in slam by making the negative response of 2 Diamonds.
We bid 2D.

East passes.

South bids 3D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 2 Clubs, 2 Diamonds, and 3 Diamonds.
Partner showed his best suit of Diamonds in response to our negative 2D response.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Diamond contract...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
But with only 24.0 points in the partnership, we have to pass.
We pass.
