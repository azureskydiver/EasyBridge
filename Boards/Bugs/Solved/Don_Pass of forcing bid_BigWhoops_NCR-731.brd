[[File Comments]]

North's comments on the bidding:


====================
***Bidding restarted***
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Have 18.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Heart.
We bid 1H.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Heart and partner's response of 1 Spade.
Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid, Spades over Hearts, which shows 5.5-17.5 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Spade contract...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
2REVAL70: Dummy's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 19.0 down to 17.5 points.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer for Heart contract...
3REVAL5: Adding 1 point(s) for the 1 extra trump(s).
2REVAL10: (with a 6-card trump suit in Hearts, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 19.0 to 21.0 points)
But our bid (1 Heart) is too low vs. the last bid of of 1 Spade, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 1 Spade.  Declarer is South; West leads.
