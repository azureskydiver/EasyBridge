S:KQ96  H:QJ73  D:8  C:AJ53
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 13.0, Distn pts = 2.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 13.0.
  QT's = 2.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  7 Likely Winners (3/2/0/2)
  6 Likely Losers (1/2/1/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suits are  Clubs, Spades
The best suit is Spades.
====================
South bids 1NT.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 No Trump.
STY0: Have 13.0/13.0 points and at least one 4+ card major suit, so bid 2 Clubs (Stayman).
We bid 2C.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 No Trump, 2 Clubs, and 2 Hearts.
STYX14: Partner replied 2 Hearts to our Stayman query, indicating a 4+ card Heart suit.
REVAL38: (with 4-card Heart trump support including a trump honor & a singleton in Diamonds, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 13.0 to 18.0 points)
BLKWD: with 13.0/13.0/18.0 points in the hand, for a total of approx. 28.0-30.0 / 33.0-35.0 pts in the partnership, explore slam possibilities with Blackwood at 4 No Trump.
But our bid (??) is too low vs. the last bid of of 2 Hearts, so we have to pass.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< ?????????? WHAT ?????????
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 Hearts.  Declarer is South; West leads.
