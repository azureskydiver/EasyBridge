S:KJ7  H:QJ95  D:7  C:A9763
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 11.0, Distn pts = 2.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0; Total pts = 11.0.
  QT's = 1.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Likely Winners (1/2/0/2)
  8 Likely Losers (2/2/1/3)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
South bids 1S.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL6a: But we don't have a suit strong enough to overcall with at the 2-level.
B00: We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 3D.
--------------------
South bids 3S.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 3 Diamonds.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Diamond contract...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
F01: Partner, opening in fourth position, is showing 6.0-10.0 points and 2+ QT's.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer for Club contract...
2REVAL16: (after re-evaluation for distribution, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 11.0 to 13.0 points)
H08: Have 11.0/11.0/11.0 points  but prefer to show our own Club suit instead of raising a minor, so bid 4 Clubs.
We bid 4C. <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<???????????
