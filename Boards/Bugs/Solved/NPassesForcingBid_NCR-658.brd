North's analysis says South's bid forcing for 1 round (which is correct) then North passes (which is wrong).

S:JT874  H:T873  D:A  C:AK3
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 12.0, Distn pts = 2.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 12.0.
  QT's = 3.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  3 Likely Winners (2/-1/1/1)
  10 Likely Losers (3/5/0/2)
Preferred suit is Spades.
====================
Opening bid for team.
Have 12.0 points in high cards, 3.0 quick tricks, and a 5-card suit, so bid 1 Spade.
We bid 1S.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Spade and partner's response of 2 Diamonds.
Partner has made a 2 over 1 bid, Diamonds over Spades, which shows 10.0-18.0 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Diamond contract...
3REVAL6: Deducting 6 point(s) for the 3 trump(s) short of 4.
But with only about 22.0-30.0 HCPS in the partnership, we don't have enough for game, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 Diamonds.  Declarer is South; West leads.
