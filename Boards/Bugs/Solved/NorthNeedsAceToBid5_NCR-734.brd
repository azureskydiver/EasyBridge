Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 13.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.5; Total pts = 11.5.
  QT's = 2.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, D, C

Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
South bids 3C.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
B00 Responding to partner's opening bid of 3 Clubs.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Club contract...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 4.
2REVAL70: Dummy's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 11.5 to 12.5 points.
SHUTR0: Partner made a preemptive 3 Clubs bid, showing a 7-card Club suit with no tricks outside the suit, and most likely 5.5-8.5 points.
SHUTR4: We have 13.0/11.5/12.5 points in hand, for a total of 18.0-21.0 points in the partnership, strong support for partner's long Club suit (holding KQ4), plus 2.0 QTs and 5 likely winners, so we can safely bid a minor game at 5 Clubs.
We bid 5C.
