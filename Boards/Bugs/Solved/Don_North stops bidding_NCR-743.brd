In this hand with 13 HCP and 4-4 in the majors, South opens 1 D.  North, with 15 HCP and a good 4 card Spade suit bids 1 S.   South is happy to raise to 2 S with his 4 Spades to the Jack.  However, at this point North passes, despite his 15 HCP and the fact that South opened and then supported his suit.  (Note that N-S are only missing 3 Aces – they have all the other face cards plus the Ace of Spades.)  North’s reason for passing is that his Spade suit is not re-biddable and his Jack doubleton in Hearts precludes bidding NT.  I suggest his strength demands a further bid and I suggest 3 Clubs (at which point South will bid either 3NT or 4 S).  Note that 3 C is a new suit on the 3 level and so is a one-round force (nowadays it is even OK to bid 3 C in this situation without actually having a biddable 4 card Club suit – simply as a temporizing strength showing bid).
 
My contention is that an opening hand opposite an opening bid must find some rebid to show his strength, even if he has to bid an un-biddable suit.
