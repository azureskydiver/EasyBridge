Playing five-card majors, Spades can be opened.
Preferred suit is Spades.
====================
South bids 1NT.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL3: But we lack the strength with 7.5 pts for a simple overcall.
B00: We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North bids 2H.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2S.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.

--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.

Bidding finished; contract is 4 Spades.  Declarer is South; West leads.
=======================
PL02: Starting play as left-hand defender.
PLYLEAD: Making opening lead as West against a contract of 4 Spades.
PLYLD4G: We have no 4-card suits other than the trump suit, so lead the 4th best trump -- the S5.
PLAYDF2: Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
PLDF2H1: Play second hand low with the Queen.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<????????????????
RCP5A: East is now known to have started with 1 Spade.
