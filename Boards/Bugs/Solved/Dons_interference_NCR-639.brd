[[File Comments]]
In this hand (played by my wife) South opened 2C (I might not have in light of the singleton king of hearts), West overcalls 2H, and North passes. 
 (The way I am used to playing, a pass is the same as a negative response, any other bid is positive. 
 With 2 aces (one a singleton) and a 5 card club suit, I would bid 3C.) 
 When South continues with 3C, North also passes ! 
 (Upon replay a takeout double by South gets North to bid only a simple 3C.)  

Judging from North’s comments about his bids, it looks like North forgets South opened with 2C, once West overcalls with 2H.

B00 Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Clubs.
R2CLUB: Partner made an artificial bid of 2 Clubs, showing either a game suit or 22+ points.  We want to respond positively if interested in a slam.
R2C04: With only 8.0/8.0 points, we deny interest in slam by making the negative response of 2 Diamonds.
But our bid (2 Diamonds) is too low vs. the last bid of of 2 Hearts, so we have to pass.
We pass.
