Opening bid for team.
Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
With 8.0/7.5 points, a 7-card Spade suit, make a preempt overcall to 3 Spades.

Rebidding after opening bid of 3 Spades and partner's pass.
Partner passed, showing < 6 points, so with 8.0/7.5 points in hand and 7.5-16.5 total partnership points, we have no choice but to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 No Trump.  Declarer is North; East leads.
=======================
Starting play as left-hand defender.
Making opening lead as East against a contract of 3 No Trump.
Lead the fourth card from our best suit (Spades) -- play the S6.
Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
Play our only card in the suit, the Jack.
Playing third ahead of dummy, we need to beat dummy's ten, so play the Jack.
Return partner's Heart suit with the Ace.
Dummy is now out of Hearts.
Partner discarded high with the nine, so consider it a suit preference signal.
Partner has indicated a preference for the Hearts suit, so lead the H2.

With no other obvious plays, fourth best with the S5.
Dummy is now out of Spades.
