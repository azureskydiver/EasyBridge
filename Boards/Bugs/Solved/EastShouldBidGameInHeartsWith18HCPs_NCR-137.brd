>>>>>>>> EAST <<<<<<<<<
S:A9  H:AKJ6  D:QJT  C:KT54
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 18.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 18.0.
  QT's = 3.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  7 Likely Winners (1/3/1/2)
  6 Likely Losers (1/1/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
A00: Have 18.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
A10: This exceeds the max pts for a 1NT opening (17), but is less than min pts for 2NT (20).  So bid the lowest openable suit of 1 Heart for now, then try for a jump shift to 2NT later.
We bid 1H.
--------------------
South bids 2C.
--------------------
West bids 2H.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Heart and partner's response of 2 Hearts. 
RDR0: With a single raise, partner is showing 6.0-10.0 points and decent (3-4 card) support for our Heart suit. <<<<<<<<<<< NO, West's bid was an overcall (10Pts)
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 5.
2REVAL18: Declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 18.0 down to 17.0 points)
R08: Using the modified trick count, we have only 5 playing tricks in hand and a total of 23.0-27.0 points in the partnership, so pass.  <<<<<<<<<<<
We pass.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 Hearts.  Declarer is East; South leads.
