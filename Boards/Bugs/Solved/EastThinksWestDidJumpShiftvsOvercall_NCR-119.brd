East thought West's overcall of 3C (over 2C) was a Jump shift

====================
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 1S.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Spade.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
F00: Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
G64: We have 8.0/8.0/8.0 points with poor support for partner's Spade suit (holding AT) and not enough strength for a 2/1 response to show our Heart suit, so bid 1NT.
We bid 1NT.
--------------------
South bids 2C.
--------------------
West bids 3C.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Spade, 1 No Trump, and 3 Clubs.
PKF6: Without a compelling suit of our own, and with lackluster support for partner's two suits, we prefer to play in No Trumps.
B4Q02: Partner made a jump shift to 3 Clubs in response to our 1 No Trump bid, showing 19.0-22.0 points.  The bid is forcing to game. <<<<<<<<<<<< NO OVERCALL
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
BN1: With 27.0+ HCPs in the partnership and a reasonably balanced hand, and all unbid suits stopped, bid 3 No Trump.
We bid 3NT.
