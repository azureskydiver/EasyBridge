[[File Comments]]
North's 2D is suspect (I'd never bid it), since the suit is weak and East opened 1D.
East's bid of 3D is wrong - rebidding a 4 card suit at the 3 level after partner has denied support.  He must pass.

North:
S:K75  H:AK  D:Q85432  C:QT
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 14.0, Distn pts = 2.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 14.0.
  QT's = 2.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Likely Winners (0/2/3/0)
  8 Likely Losers (3/0/3/2)
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
East bids 1D.
--------------------
South doubles.
--------------------
West bids 1NT.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Partner has doubled for takeout.
Partner's takeout indicates 11.5+ HCPs, for a total in the partnership of 25.5-35.5 points.
But Right-hand opponent has bid after partner's double, so the takeout is no longer in effect.
However, assuming partner has 12+ HCPs, that amount combined with our 14.0/14.0 points totals 26.0/26.0 pts, which is enough for us to bid 2 Diamonds.
We bid 2D.
--------------------
East bids 3D.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 2 Diamonds and partner's pass.
Partner passed, showing < 6 points, so with 14.0/14.0 points in hand and 14.0-23.0 total partnership points, we have no choice but to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Diamonds.  Declarer is East; South leads.
=======================

East: 
S:AT6  H:97642  D:AJ76  C:A
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 13.0, Distn pts = 2.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 13.0.
  QT's = 3.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  3 Likely Winners (0/0/2/1)
  10 Likely Losers (3/5/2/0)
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
Opening bid for team.
Have 13.0 points in high cards and 3.0 quick tricks, so bid 1 Diamond.
We bid 1D.
--------------------
South doubles.
--------------------
West bids 1NT.
--------------------
North bids 2D.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Diamond and partner's response of 1 No Trump.
With a 1NT response, partner is showing 9.5-11.5 points, a lack of good support for our Diamond suit, and no other suit available to bid at an appropriate level.
With 13.0/13.0 points and no other good suits, jump rebid the Diamond suit at 3 Diamonds.
We bid 3D.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Diamonds.  Declarer is East; South leads.
