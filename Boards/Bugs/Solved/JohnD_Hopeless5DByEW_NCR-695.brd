[[File Comments]]
Significant misunderstanding between E and W's bidding.
W raises 3D to 4D with 2-card support and 4 points, while E analysis says "With a single raise, partner is showing 10.0-18.0 points and decent (3-4 card) support for our Diamond suit."
The final contract (5D) is hopeless and goes 3 down.

East:
S:9  H:Q94  D:AKQJ86  C:KQ7
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 17.0, Distn pts = 5.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;

Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Diamond and partner's response of 1 Spade.
Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid, Spades over Diamonds, which shows 6.0-18.0 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Spade contract...
3REVAL7: Adding 3 point(s) for the solid Diamond suit.
3REVAL6: Deducting 3 point(s) for the 3 trump(s) short of 4.
We have 26.0- pts in the partnership, but don't like partner's suit, don't have a good second suit, and NT is not a good option, so jump rebid the Diamond suit at 3 Diamonds.
We bid 3D.
--------------------
South bids 3H.
--------------------
West bids 4D.

North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.

2REVAL10: (with a 6-card trump suit in Diamonds, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 20.0 to 22.0 points)
We have a total of 32.0-40.0 points in the partnership for a minor suit, so bid game at 5 Diamonds.
We bid 5D.
