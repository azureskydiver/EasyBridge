With 19 HCP South opens 1C and then jumps to 2NT over the North bid of 1D.  At this point North bids 4C (Gerber) and South, with 3 aces replies 4NT.  Now North forgets that 4NT meant 3 aces in reply to his Gerber 4C, and thinks 4NT is Blackwood asking him for aces.  He bids 5D showing his one ace.  South takes this as a sign-off in North’s first suit so he passes.  The hand is cold for 7NT.
