[[File Comments]]
Cannot get North to bid over interference.

This hand makes 7 Hearts, but we cannot get there (or even to 6).  South opens 2 Clubs, West overcalls 2 Spades, North passes (??), East passes, and no matter what bid South makes it gets passed out (even 3 Spades !).  The proper bid for South is 3 Hearts (naming his suit) and now North MUST bid something like 4 Diamonds (with a bust he should bid 4 Hearts, although with the 60 part score he might have a legitimate pass).  North’s reason for the pass is he doesn’t understand 3 Hearts !  With 8 HCP, a singleton, and a strong 6 card Diamond suit, North shouldn’t even pass on his first turn since he has enough for a positive response.

====================
***Bidding Cancelled***
South bids 2C.
--------------------
West bids 2S.
--------------------
B00 Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Clubs.
R2CLUB: Partner made an artificial bid of 2 Clubs, showing either a game suit or 22+ points.  We want to respond positively if interested in a slam.
R2C04: With only 8.0/9.0 points, we deny interest in slam by making the negative response of 2 Diamonds.
But our bid (2 Diamonds) is too low vs. the last bid of of 2 Spades, so we have to pass.  <<<<< BB Does this
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3H.

West passes.

Rebidding as responder after bids of 2 Clubs, Pass, and 3 Hearts.
B4Z00: Partner made a response which we don't understand; simply pass.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<????
We pass.

PLAY: West leads the SK.
