  QT's = 4.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D

Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Have a powerful suit in Diamonds.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
E01: Have 17.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Diamond.
We bid 1D.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Diamond and partner's response of 1 Spade.
B3U00: Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid, Spades over Diamonds, which shows 5.5-17.5 points and is forcing for one round.  <<<<<<<<<<
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Spade contract...
3REVAL7: Adding 3 point(s) for the solid Diamond suit.
3REVAL5: Adding 1 point(s) for the -1 extra trump(s).
2REVAL70: Dummy's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 18.0 down to 16.5 points.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer for Diamond contract...
3REVAL5: Adding 1 point(s) for the 1 extra trump(s).
2REVAL10: (with a 6-card trump suit in Diamonds, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 18.0 to 20.0 points)
But our bid (1 Diamond) is too low vs. the last bid of of 1 Spade, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 1 Spade.  Declarer is South; West leads.
