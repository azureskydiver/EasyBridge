F00: Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
I08: Have 8.0/6.5/15.5 points with 5-card support for partner's Hearts (holding Q8763), which is too strong for a limit raise, so we have to temporarily shift to Spades with a bid of 1 Spade.
We bid 1S.

B4E32: We have 8.0/6.5pts in hand and 27.5-35.5pts in the partnership, but have no good fit with partner and no rebiddable suit, so we have no choice but to shift to another suit.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< NO HAS GOOD HEART SUPPORT <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<??????????
