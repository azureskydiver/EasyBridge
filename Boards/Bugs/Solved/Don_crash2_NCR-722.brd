Crash2.brd is the file renamed from the autosave file.  
Crash3.brd I saved just immediately before the crash;  a single mouse click after loading it will crash.

The bidding for the crash is:
West           North              East                 South
Pass            Pass                1C                   1D
Pass            2D                  Double             Redouble
Pass            Pass                Pass
 
Replace South’s Redouble with 3D and there is no crash.
