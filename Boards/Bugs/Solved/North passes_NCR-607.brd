It looks like EasyBridge is too timid in a competitive bidding situation.   South opens a minimum hand with 1C, West overcalls 1D and North passes with 11 HCP and a good 5 card spade suit and 4 hearts to the K.  With a rock bottom minimum opening, South passes, letting E/W play in 1D where N/S should be playing for a major suit part score.
 
I do not understand North’s analysis in justifying his pass, but in this situation as North I would bid 1S, the same as I would have if West had not bid.  Even a negative double would be better than a pass (although with 5 spades, I like 1S better).  Note that (at least the way I play negative doubles) the 1S bid would guarantee 5 spades, since with only 4 spades (or hearts) the preferred bid would be a negative double.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>North's analysis for his pass:

S:KQJ62  H:KT96  D:T5  C:Q6
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 11.0, Distn pts = 2.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-2.0;
Total pts = 9.0.
  QT's = 1.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Likely Winners (4/1/0/0)
  8 Likely Losers (1/3/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, Spades can be opened.
Preferred suit is Spades.

Partner is showing 12.0-21.0 points and 2+ QT's.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer for Spade contract...
2REVAL16: (after re-evaluation for distribution, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 9.0 to 11.0 points)
But we have only 11.0/9.0/9.0 points with weak trump support, so we have to pass.
