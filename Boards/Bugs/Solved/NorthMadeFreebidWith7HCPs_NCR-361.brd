--------------------
West bids 2H.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 No Trump.
A10: Partner's bid indicates 15-17 points with balanced hand.
C16: Have 7.0/7.0 points with a 4-card Spade suit (holding 8742), so bid 2 Spades.
We bid 2S.   <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< FREEBID with  7 pts???
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 No Trump, 2 Spades, and 3 Spades.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 5.
3REVAL8: Since the trump suit is only topped by a eight, deduct 5 points.
2REVAL18: Declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract in Spades from 7.0 down to 1.0 points)
B4H14: Partner made a single raise of our 2 Spades bid to 3 Spades, showing 12.0 -18.0 points and 3+ trump cards.
B4H30: With only 7.0/7.0/1.0 pts in hand, for a total in the partnership of 13.0-19.0 points, a game is unlikely, so pass.
We pass.
