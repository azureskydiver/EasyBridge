West should NOT lead Clubs - Dummy is all winners
>>>>>>>>> WEST<<<<<<<<<
PLAY: West wins the round.

PLAY1: Leading card, using default player logic.
PLYLD32: Partner is void in Clubs and may still have some trumps, so lead the C6.   <<<<<<<< Only 1 trump out, it will win no matter what
PLAY: We lead the C6.
