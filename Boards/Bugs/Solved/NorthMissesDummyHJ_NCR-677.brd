***Bidding restarted***
East bids 2NT.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 3D.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
But we lack the strength with 5.0 pts for a simple overcall.
We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 3H.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 4NT.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.

West passes.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.

Dummy is now out of Spades.
Dummy is shown to be void in Spades.
Starting play as right-hand defender.
We do not have a winner in the Spade suit, so discard low with the two.
Partner's SA can win the trick, so discard the S2.
Dummy is now out of Clubs.
Since we can win the next round of Clubs, we want to signal by discarding high in the suit.
Begin the high-low signal with the eight.
Partner's ten is high or we can't beat the highest card, so discard the C8.
We can't beat West's Ace, so discard the H9.
Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
West led an honor (the Queen), so cover it with our King.
We have the boss trumps, so pull declarer's trumps by leading the HT.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<NO Dummy has HJ
