Playing five-card majors, Hearts can be opened.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
South bids 2D.
--------------------
West bids 2S.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Diamonds.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Diamond contract...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
RWKT: Partner made a weak 2-bid, showing a a 6+ card suit with 5.5-10.5 points, less than 4 cards in the other major, no voids, and no more than one singleton.
RWKT4: We only have 9.0/8.0/9.0 points, for a partnership total of 14.5-19.5 points, which is probably not enough for game.
RWKT8: And we don't like partner's Diamond suit (holding 82), so shift to our preferred Heart suit in a bid of 3 Hearts.  <<<??????????????????
We bid 3H.
