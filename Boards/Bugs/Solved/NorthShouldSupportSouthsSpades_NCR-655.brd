4REVAL21: Adjusting by 1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 4-card Spade trump support including a trump honor & a singleton in Diamonds, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 11.0 to 16.0 points)
F01: Partner, opening in third position, is showing 10.0-20.5 points and 2+ QT's.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer for Club contract...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 5.
I08: Have 12.0/11.0/16.0 points with 4-card support for partner's Spades (holding KJ53), which is too strong for a limit raise, so we have to temporarily shift to Clubs with a bid of 2 Clubs.
We bid 2C.

South bids 3C.

West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Spade, 2 Clubs, and 3 Clubs.
B4H14: Partner made a single raise of our 2 Clubs bid to 3 Clubs, showing 12.0 -20.5 points and 3+ trump cards.
B4H35: We have a total of approx. 26.0-36.5 in the partnership, but we do not have a rebiddable suit, nor do we have enough stoppers for a NT contract, so we have to sign off on partner's 3 Clubs bid.
We pass.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<NO<<<<<<<<<<<
--------------------
East passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 3 Clubs.  Declarer is North; East leads.
