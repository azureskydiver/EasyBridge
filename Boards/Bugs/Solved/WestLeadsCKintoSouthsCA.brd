West leads CK (clubs are trump) into South's CA
PLYLD43: With no good card to lead, lead the CK...

Could lead HQ with singleton HJ on board

>>>> Later play: Leads CK because pard has indicated a preference???
Clubs are trump!!!
PLYLDPRF4: Partner ... so lead the CK.

>>> Later West leads DA when declarer has show out of Diamonds.
PLYLDA: With no other obvious plays, cash a winner with the DA.
