====================
Opening bid for team.
A00: Have 15.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
A08: This meet the rqmts for the 1NT opening range (15-17), so bid 1NT.
We bid 1NT.

North passes.
--------------------
East bids 3NT.
--------------------
South doubles.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 No Trump and partner's response of 3 No Trump.
NT10: Partner's raise from our 1 No Trump to 3 No Trump indicates a balanced hand and 10.0-15.0 HCPs, for a total of 25.0+ HCPs in the partnership.
B3N18: With approx. 25.0-30.0 HCPS in the partnership, partner's game bid of 3NT seems appropriate, so pass.
We pass.
