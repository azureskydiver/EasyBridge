====================
Opening bid for team.
Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1H.
--------------------
West bids 2C.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Heart.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 4.
Partner, opening in third position, is showing 10.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
But we have only 8.0/5.5/5.5 points with weak trump support, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Heart, Pass, and 2 Diamonds.
Partner bid another suit (third suit in partnership) at 2 Diamonds after our Pass response, showing 12.0-18.0 points.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 4.
Without a compelling suit of our own, and with lackluster support for partner's two suits, we prefer to play in No Trumps.
With only 8.0/5.5 points in hand, for a total in the partnership of 17.5-23.5 points, we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 Diamonds.  Declarer is South; West leads.
