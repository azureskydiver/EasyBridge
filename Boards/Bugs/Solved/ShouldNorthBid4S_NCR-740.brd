How to bid this?  Should North bid 4S?
>>>>>>NORTH
South bids 2S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
B00 Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Spades.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Spade contract...
4REVAL21: Adjusting by 1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Spade trump support including a trump honor & a singleton in Clubs, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 20.0 to 23.0 points.
RWKT: Partner made a weak 2-bid, showing a a 6+ card suit with 5.5-10.5 points, less than 4 cards in the other major, no voids, and no more than one singleton.
RWKT40: We have 20.0/20.0/20.0 points, for a partnership total of 25.5-30.5 points, so we may be interested in a possible slam.
RWKT48: We don't have very good support for partner's Spade suit (holding AT6, and don't have the proper distribution for a NT response, so jump shift to 4 Diamonds.  Slam possibilities may be explored later.
We bid 4D.
