====================
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 1D.
--------------------
South bids 1H.
--------------------
West bids 3D.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Heart.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Heart suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 17.0-24.0 points.
BN1: With 17.0+ HCPs in the partnership and a reasonably balanced hand, though without stoppers in all suits, bid 1 No Trump.
But our bid is too low vs. the last bid of of 3 Diamonds, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Heart, Pass, and 3 Hearts.
B4Z00: Partner made a response which we don't understand; simply pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Hearts.  Declarer is South; West leads.
