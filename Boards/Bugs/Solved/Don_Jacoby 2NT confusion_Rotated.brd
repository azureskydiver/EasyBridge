In this hand West opens a normal 1H .  East thinks he should revalue his own hand to 14 points (I might quibble about that but I won’t) and responds with a Jacoby 2NT .  With 15 points and no singletons or voids West responds 3NT (again I might quibble about maybe bidding 4H, but I won’t).  At this point I think East forgets all about the prior conventional bidding and takes the 3NT bid as natural, revalues his hand without counting the void and passes(?) instead of going to 4H !
 
At 3NT East manages to go down 4.  Now maybe 4H wouldn’t make either because of the 4-0 heart split, but it wouldn’t be a disaster either.
