N plays the ten of diamonds under West's king, when he should play the 7. This is particularly silly because the ten will be the master after this trick!

====================
West bids 1S.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
But we lack the strength for a simple overcall.
We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 2C.
--------------------
South bids 2D.
--------------------
West bids 2S.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Diamonds.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 4.
Partner overcalled at the 2-level, indicating a good 5+ card Diamond suit, 9.5-14.5 points, and probably 6+ playing tricks.
The total point count in the partnership is therefore 9.5-14.5 points.
This is not enough to bid any higher, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 3S.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Spades.  Declarer is West; North leads.
=======================
Starting play as left-hand defender.
Making opening lead as North against a contract of 3 Spades.
Lead the bottom card of partner's Diamond suit (the four.
We do not have a winner in the Diamond suit, so discard low with the ten.
We can't beat West's King, so discard the DT.
Dummy is now out of Diamonds.
Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
Play second hand low with the two.
