OVRCL3: But we lack the strength for a simple overcall.
B00: We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North bids 3S.
--------------------
East doubles.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening double.
TKOTR: Partner has doubled for takeout.
TKORT8: Partner's takeout indicates 12.0+ HCPs, for a total in the partnership of 17.5-26.5 points.
TKOTR20: With 7.0 HCPs and a balanced hand, respond with 1 No Trump.
But our bid is too low vs. the last bid of of 3 Spades, so we have to pass.
We pass.

North passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 3 Spades (doubled).  Declarer is South; West leads.
