West passes.

North bids 1S.

Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL3: But we lack the strength with 7.0 pts for a simple overcall.
B00: We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
South bids 2C.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North bids 2NT.

Bidding finished; contract is 3 No Trump.  Declarer is North; East leads.
=======================
PL02: Starting play as left-hand defender.
PLYLEAD: Making opening lead as East against a contract of 3 No Trump.
PLYLD4A: Lead the fourth card from our best suit (Spades) -- play the S5.
PLYSIG1: Partner discarded low with the three, so consider it a signal that he dislikes the suit.
PLAYB48: We can't beat North's ten, so discard the H2.
PLAYDF2: Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
PLDF2H3: Cover with the five.
PLAYB41: Play the Ace to win the trick.
PLYLD76: Continue developing our Spade suit by playing the SK.  <<<<<<<<<<<<< No AQT are out
