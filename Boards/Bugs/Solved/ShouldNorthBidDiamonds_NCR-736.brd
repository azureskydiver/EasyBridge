REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer for Diamond contract...
2REVAL16: (after re-evaluation for distribution, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 10.5 to 11.5 points)
I08: Have 11.0/10.5/12.5 points with 5-card support for partner's Diamonds (holding K9852), which is too strong for a limit raise, so we have to temporarily shift to Spades with a bid of 2 Spades. <<<<<<<<  ????????????????????????

B4H35: We have a total of approx. 22.5-33.0 in the partnership, but we do not have a rebiddable suit, nor do we have enough stoppers for a NT contract, so we have to sign off on partner's 3 Spades bid.
We pass.   <<<<<<<<<<<<NOT with only 3!!!
