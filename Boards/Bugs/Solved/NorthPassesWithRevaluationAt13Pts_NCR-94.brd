  QT's = 1.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Likely Winners (2/0/3/0)
  8 Likely Losers (2/2/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suits are  Diamonds, Spades
The best suit is Diamonds.
====================
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1D.
--------------------
West bids 2C.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Diamond.
REVAL38: (with 5-card Diamond trump support including a trump honor & doubletons in Clubs and Hearts, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 7.0 to 13.0 points)
F00: Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
F04: But we have only 7.0/7.0/13.0 points against a minor suit bid, so we prefer to pass.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<???????????
We pass.
