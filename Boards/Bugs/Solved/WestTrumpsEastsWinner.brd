Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
South passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 1H.
--------------------
South bids 2C.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Heart.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
F01: Partner, opening in fourth position, is showing 10.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
G64: We have 8.0/7.5/7.5 points with poor support for partner's Heart suit (holding J) and not enough strength for a 2/1 response to show our Diamond suit, so bid 1NT.
But our bid is too low vs. the last bid of of 2 Clubs, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 Clubs.  Declarer is South; West leads.

PLCSW9: With no other good options, cash a winner in the Diamond suit, the Ace
PLYSIG0: Partner discarded high with the eight, so consider it a suit preference signal.
PLYLDPRF4: Partner has indicated a preference for the Diamonds suit, so lead the D4.
RCP5A: South is now known to have started with 1 Diamond.
RCP5A: East is now known to have started with 2 Diamonds.
PLAYB23: We can't beat the opponent's three of trumps, so discard the D5.
PLAYDF2: Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
PLDF2J2: Since there is at least one higher card outstanding in the Heart suit than the one led (the six), partner could still have it and win the round.
PL2DFM2: We'd like to trump here, but Dummy can overruff, so discard the S5.
RCP5A: West is now known to have started with 1 Heart.
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Diamonds.
PLAYB23: We can't beat the opponent's five of trumps, so discard the D6.

PLAYB52: Although we could trump this hand, partner's SQ is high, so discard the D7.
