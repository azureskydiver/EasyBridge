Playing five-card majors, Spades can be opened.
Preferred suit is Spades.
====================
South passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 1H.
--------------------
South bids 2D.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Heart.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
Partner, opening in fourth position, is showing 10.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
Have 10.0/10.0/10.0 points with poor (A9) support for partner's Heart suit but hold a openable 6-card Spade suit, so bid 1 Spade instead.
But our bid is too low vs. the last bid of of 2 Diamonds, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North bids 3D.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Diamonds.  Declarer is South; West leads.
=======================
Starting play as left-hand defender.
Making opening lead as West against a contract of 3 Diamonds.
Lead the top card of partner's Heart suit (the Ace.
South is now known to have started with 0 Hearts.
Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
Play our only card in the suit, the Ace.
Partner likes the Heart suit, but declarer has shown out of the suit and _may_ be able to ruff, so avoid leading the suit if possible.
With no other clear plays available, lead a card from the unbid Spade suit.
With no cards in the suit led and no trumps, we discard the S3.
West is now known to have started with 1 Diamond.
We can't beat the opponent's ten of trumps, so discard the H9.
Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
Cover with the winner Queen.
Play second hand low with the Queen.
East is now known to have started with 1 Spade.
Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
Cover with the winner ten.
Cover with the ten.
Dummy is now out of Spades.
Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
Cover with the winner Queen.
Play second hand low with the Queen.<<<<<<<<<<<<================= over King by South
