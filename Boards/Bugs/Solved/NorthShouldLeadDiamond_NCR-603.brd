Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 6.0, Distn pts = 7.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0; Total pts = 9.0.
  QT's = 1.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Likely Winners (0/0/6/-1)
  8 Likely Losers (1/1/1/5)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Have a strong suit in Diamonds.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
South bids 2S.
--------------------
West doubles.
--------------------
B00 Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Spades.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Spade contract...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
RWKT: Partner made a weak 2-bid, showing a a 6+ card suit with 5.5-10.5 points, less than 4 cards in the other major, no voids, and no more than one singleton.
RWKT4: We only have 6.0/9.0/6.0 points, for a partnership total of 11.5-16.5 points, which is probably not enough for game.
RWKT10: And since we don't like partner's Spade suit (holding 9), have no good suit of our own, and hold an imbalanced hand, we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 3H.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Hearts.  Declarer is East; South leads.
=======================
PL03: Starting play as right-hand defender.
PLDF40a: Play higher with the Ace.
PLCSW9: With no other good options, cash a winner in the Diamond suit, the Queen
RCP5A: South is now known to have started with 1 Diamond.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<note
PLYLD44: With no other obvious plays, lead a low trump H3.
