There's something wrong with the computer's declarer play here. The contract is easily makeable (should get a couple of overtricks) but somehow goes 1 down. I can't figure out why the computer seems to just take its winners and rather than trying for finesses!

West:
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Have 18.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
This exceeds the max pts for a 1NT opening (14), but is less than min pts for 2NT (21).  So bid the lowest openable suit of 1 Diamond for now, then try for a jump shift to 2NT later.
We bid 1D.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 1H.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Diamond and partner's response of 1 Heart.
Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid after an earlier pass, Hearts over Diamonds, which shows 6.0-12.0 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Heart contract...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 4.
2REVAL70: Dummy's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 19.0 down to 17.0 points.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer for Diamond contract...
3REVAL5: Adding 1 point(s) for the 1 extra trump(s).
2REVAL10: (with a 5-card trump suit in Diamonds, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 19.0 to 20.0 points)
With a balanced distribution and weak support for partner's Heart suit (holding 96), bid 1 No Trump.
We bid 1NT.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 1 No Trump.  Declarer is East; South leads.
