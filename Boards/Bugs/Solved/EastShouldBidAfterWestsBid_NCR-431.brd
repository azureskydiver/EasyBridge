Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVERCL8: Have a good 5-card Club suit with 11.0/11.0 points and 6 playing tricks, so overcall the opponents' 1 Spade with a bid of 2 Clubs.
We bid 2C.

South passes.

North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 2 Clubs and partner's response of 3 Hearts.
OVRRB20: Partner jumped in his Hearts suit in response to our 2 Clubs overcall, indicating 6+ cards and approx. 16.0-22.0 points.
OVRRB88: As we lack agreement in suits and have only 27.0-33.0 team points, we have no good options other than to pass.  <<<<<<<<<<<< NO ???????????
We pass.
