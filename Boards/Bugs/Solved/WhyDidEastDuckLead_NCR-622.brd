Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 15.0, Distn pts = 3.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.0; Total pts = 14.0.

  Sure Stoppers in: S, D, C

Playing five-card majors, Spades can be opened.
Preferred suits are  Diamonds, Spades
The best suit is Spades.
====================
Opening bid for team.
E01: Have 15.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Spade.
We bid 1S.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 2C.
--------------------
South bids 2H.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Spade and partner's response of 2 Clubs.
B3W00: Partner has made a 2 over 1 bid, Clubs over Spades, which shows 9.5-17.5 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Club contract...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
B3W28: With weak 2-card support for partner's Clubs (holding K5) and a openable second suit in Diamonds (holding K9764), show it in a 3 Diamonds bid.
We bid 3D.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 4D.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
RDR0: With a single raise, partner is showing 9.5-17.5 points and decent (3-4 card) support for our Diamond suit.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer for Diamond contract...
2REVAL16: (after re-evaluation for distribution, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 14.0 to 17.0 points)
R27: We have a total of 26.5-34.5 points in the partnership, which is not quite enough for game in a minor suit, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 4 Diamonds.  Declarer is West; North leads.
