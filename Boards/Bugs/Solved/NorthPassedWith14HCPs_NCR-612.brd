====================
West bids 1H.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL6a: But we don't have a suit strong enough to overcall with at the 2-level.
B00: We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
B00 Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Spade.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Spade contract...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Spade suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 20.5-27.5 points.
ROVRC99: We have insufficient strength for either a raise, suit shift, or NT bid, so pass.   <<<<<<<<<<<<NO  Try NT ???
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 1 Spade.  Declarer is South; West leads.
