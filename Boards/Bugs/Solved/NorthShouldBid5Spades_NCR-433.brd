Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Spade and partner's response of 5 Diamonds.
B3W00: Partner has made a 2 over 1 bid, Diamonds over Spades, which shows 10.0-18.0 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
B3W20: With our self-supporting Spade suit with 8 cards and 3 honors, and 11.0/16.0 points in hand, and a total of 26.0-34.0 in the partnership, we can make a game contract in the suit with little help from partner, so bid 4 Spades.   <<<<<<<<<<<<< NO, need to bid 5S <<<<<<<<<<<<<<
But our bid (4 Spades) is too low vs. the last bid of of 5 Diamonds, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 5 Diamonds.  Declarer is South; West leads.
=======================
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Hearts.
RCP25: Dummy is shown to be void in Hearts.
