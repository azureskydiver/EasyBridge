[[File Comments]]
 Here East opens with a perfectly normal bid of 1H (N-S pass throughout).  
West correctly decides he is too strong for a limit raise, 
but decides to temporize by bidding his 3 card club suit  (what is wrong with Jacoby 2NT ?).  <<<<<<<<<<<   How many points????

Now East recognizes this as a forcing bid, but passes anyway 
after considering and rejecting 2S (on a 3 card suit ?) 
since it would be a reverse, and rejecting 2H 
because of his weakness in the suit 
(and he only estimates the partnership has 22 to 30 points !!  ).  
It seems like East has a default bid of pass when 
he cannot find an optimum bid.  
The forcing nature of West’s 2C bid ought to require East to bid, 
so he must choose the lesser of evils and bid 2H or even 3C.  
With an estimated 22 to 30 partnership points, 
a forward-going invitational bid is called for on it’s own merits, 
even if the 2C bid were not forcing.

Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Heart and partner's response of 2 Clubs.
B3W00: Partner has made a 2 over 1 bid, Clubs over Hearts, which shows 9.5-17.5 points and is forcing for one round.

4REVAL21: Adjusting by 1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Club trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Diamonds, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 12.0 to 13.0 points)
RevV0: We'd like to bid the Spade suit, but we can't reverse with less than 17 points.
RevV2: And since the 3rd best suit (Clubs) is not strong enough to bid, we have to rebid the original Heart suit.
B3W42: But with only about 21.5-29.5 HCPS in the partnership, we don't have enough for game, so pass.
We pass.
