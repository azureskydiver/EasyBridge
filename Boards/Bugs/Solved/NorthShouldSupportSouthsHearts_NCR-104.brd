>>>>>> NORTH<<<<<<<
S:AQ42  H:A65  D:A9876  C:T
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 14.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 14.0.
  QT's = 3.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  7 Likely Winners (3/1/3/0)
  6 Likely Losers (1/2/2/1)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suits are  Diamonds, Spades
The best suit is Diamonds.
====================
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
E01: Have 14.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Diamond.
We bid 1D.

West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Diamond and partner's response of 1 Heart.
B3U00a: Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid after an earlier pass, Hearts over Diamonds, which shows 5.5-11.5 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL38: (with 3-card Heart trump support including a trump honor & a singleton in Clubs, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 14.0 to 17.0 points)
RevV0: We'd like to bid the Spade suit, but we can't reverse with less than 17 points.
RevV2: And since the 3rd best suit (Clubs) is not strong enough to bid, we have to rebid the original Diamond suit.
B3U54: With weak support for partner's Heart suit (holding A65), 14.0/14.0/17.0 points, and a second openable suit in Diamonds (holding A9876), show it in a 2 Diamonds bid.
We bid 2D.
--------------------
East passes.

South bids 3D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
RDR0: With a single raise, partner is showing 6.0-11.5 points and decent (3-4 card) support for our Diamond suit.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
2REVAL16: (after re-evaluation for distribution, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 14.0 to 16.0 points)
RDR5: With a total of only 22.0-27.5 points in the partnership, we have to pass partners's  3 Diamonds bid.
We pass.
