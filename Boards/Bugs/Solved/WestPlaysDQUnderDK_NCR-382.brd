I led DK and computer plays DQ on it, with the explanation "The opponents led a Diamond, so play the DQ from dummy to try and force out the Ace now".  This makes no sense...


S:KQ  H:A7  D:T7  C:KQ75432
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 14.0, Distn pts = 8.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 19.0.
  QT's = 3.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  8 Likely Winners (1/1/0/6)
  5 Likely Losers (1/1/2/1)
Have a strong suit in Clubs.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
North passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Have 14.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Club.
We bid 1C.
--------------------
South doubles.
--------------------
West bids 1NT.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Club and partner's response of 1 No Trump.
With a 1NT response, partner is showing 9.5-11.5 points, a lack of good support for our Club suit, and no other suit available to bid at an appropriate level.
With 14.0/19.0 points and no other good suits, jump rebid the Club suit at 3 Clubs.
We bid 3C.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Clubs.  Declarer is East; South leads.

Dummy's hand has been laid down; now planning the play with a contract of 3 Clubs.

Planning the play...

We have 9 sure tricks against a requirement of 9 for the 3C contract.
The Spade suit looks the most promising for further development.
Checking play sequencing...
We want to work on developing the Spade suit first, so move its plays up to the front if possible.
Interleaving plays...
The tentative list of available plays is as follows:
------>
 Play 1: Pull a round of trumps with the King in hand.
 Play 2: Pull a round of trumps with the Queen in hand.
 Play 3: Pull a round of trumps with the Jack in dummy if necessary.
 Play 4: Ruff a Spade in hand.
 Play 5: Ruff a Spade in hand.
 Play 6: Lead a low Spade from dummy and finesse the Queen in hand against South.
 Play 7: Lead a low Spade from dummy and finesse the King in hand against South.
 Play 8: Cash the King of Spades in hand.
 Play 9: Ruff a Heart in hand.
 Play 10: Ruff a Diamond in hand.
 Play 11: Lead a low Heart from hand and finesse the Queen in dummy against North.
 Play 12: Play the Jack of Diamonds from dummy to force out the opponents' Ace.
 Play 13: Play the Jack of Diamonds from dummy to force out the opponents' Nine.
 Play 14: Cash the Queen of Diamonds in dummy.
 Play 15: Cash the Ace of Hearts in hand.
 Play 16: Cash the Jack of Clubs in dummy.
 Play 17: Cash the Ten of Clubs in dummy.
 Play 18: Cash the Eight of Clubs in dummy.
 Play 19: Cash the Queen of Clubs in hand.
 Play 20: Cash the King of Clubs in hand.
 Play 21: Cash the Seven of Clubs in hand.
The planning is complete.
---------------------------
PLFRC22: The opponents led a Diamond, so play the DQ from dummy to try and force out the Ace now.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<????????????
No usable plays found for the current situation.
Use this opportunity to discard the D7.
We can't beat South's King, so discard the D7.
