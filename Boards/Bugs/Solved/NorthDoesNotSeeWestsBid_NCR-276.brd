North does not see West's 2D bid
>>>>>>> NORTH<<<<<<
=====================================
Received hand:
  S:Q872  H:9  D:AT65  C:AQ84
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 12.0, Distn pts = 2.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 12.0.
  QT's = 2.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  4 Likely Winners (1/0/1/2)
  9 Likely Losers (3/1/3/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suits are  Clubs, Diamonds
The best suit is Clubs.
====================
Opening bid for team.
E02: Have 12.0 points in high cards and 2.5 quick tricks, so bid 1 Club.
We bid 1C.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1H.
--------------------
West bids 2D.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Club and partner's response of 1 Heart.
B3U00: Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid, Hearts over Clubs, which shows 5.0-17.0 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
RevV0: We'd like to bid the Diamond suit, but we can't reverse with less than 17 points.
RevV2: And since the 3rd best suit (Hearts) is not strong enough to bid, we have to rebid the original Club suit.
B3U44: With weak support for partner's Hearts (holding 9), and no other available bid, bid 1 No Trump.  <<<<<<<<<<<<< NOT Enough West bid 2D
But our bid (1 No Trump) is too low vs. the last bid of of 2 Diamonds, so we have to pass.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
