S:KQ75  H:5  D:QT953  C:J94
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 8.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.5;
Total pts = 6.5.
  QT's = 1.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  6 Likely Winners (3/0/3/0)
  7 Likely Losers (1/1/2/3)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Spades.
====================
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 1C.
--------------------
South bids 1H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Heart.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Heart suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 14.0-21.0 points.
ROVRC99: We have insufficient strength for either a raise, suit shift, or NT bid, so pass.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<< ??????????
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 1 Heart.  Declarer is South; West leads.
