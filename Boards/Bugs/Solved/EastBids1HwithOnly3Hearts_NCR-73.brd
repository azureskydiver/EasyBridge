--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Club.
REVAL38: (with 3-card Club trump support including a trump honor, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 12.0 to 13.0 points)
F00: Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
I14: Have 12.0/12.0/13.0 points but we prefer to shift instead of raising a minor Club suit, so show our own Heart suit by bidding 1 Heart.
We bid 1H.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< ONLY HAS 3 Hearts ??????????????  NT better???

B4H18: With only 12.0/12.0/8.0 pts in hand, for a total in the partnership of 20.0-29.0 points, a game is unlikely, so pass.
We pass.
