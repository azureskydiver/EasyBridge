West ruffs East's winning HJ
>>>>>>> WEST <<<<<
=====================================
Received hand:
  S:KQ832  H:3  D:K9  C:JT732
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 9.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.0;
Total pts = 8.0.
  QT's = 1.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  7 Likely Winners (4/0/1/2)
  6 Likely Losers (1/1/1/3)
Playing five-card majors, Spades can be opened.
Preferred suit is Spades.
====================
Opening bid for team.
Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North bids 1D.
--------------------
East bids 1H.
--------------------
South bids 4D.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Heart.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Heart suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 15.0-22.0 points.
BN1: With 16.0+ HCPs in the partnership and a reasonably balanced hand, though without stoppers in all suits, bid 1 No Trump.
But our bid (1 No Trump) is too low vs. the last bid of of 4 Diamonds, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 4 Diamonds.  Declarer is North; East leads.
