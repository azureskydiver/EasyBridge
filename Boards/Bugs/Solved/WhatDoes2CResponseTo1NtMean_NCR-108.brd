What does North's 2C response to 1NT mean?
>>>>>>>> NORTH <<<<<<<<<<
S:AJ2  H:A74  D:T652  C:932
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 9.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 9.0.
  QT's = 2.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H
  Probable Stoppers in:
  2 Likely Winners (1/1/0/0)
  11 Likely Losers (2/2/4/3)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1NT.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 No Trump.
A10: Partner's bid indicates 15-17 points with balanced hand.
B00: Responding with a  balanced hand and 9.0 HCP's, for a total in partnership of 24.0-26.0 HCPs.
B20: If partner has a max opening hand (17 HCPs), we can make game at 3NT, and so we want to bid an invitational 2NT.  However, since we're playing 4-suit Jacoby Transfers, we have to bid 2C instead.   <<<<<<<<<<<<<< ????????????????
We bid 2C.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 No Trump, 2 Clubs, and 2 Diamonds.
B4T02: Partner bid another suit at 2 Diamonds after his opening of 1NT and our response of 2 Clubs.
REVAL38: (with 4-card Diamond trump support, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 9.0 to 10.0 points)
YN1: With 25.0-27.0 points in the partnership and 4-card support for partner's  Diamond suit (holding T652), raise to 4 Diamonds.
We bid 4D.

East passes.
