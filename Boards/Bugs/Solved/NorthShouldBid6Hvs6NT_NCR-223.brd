====================
***Bidding restarted***
West bids 3D.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
TKOUT: With 13.0/13.0 points and support for all unbid suits, bid a takeout double.
We bid Dbl.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 4H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of Double and partner's response of 4 Hearts.
TKORb41: Partner has jumped to game in Hearts, indicating 13+ pts and a 5+ card suit.
TKRb49: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 43.0-35.0 pts.
BLKWD: with 13.0/13.0/13.0 points in the hand, for a total of approx. 43.0-35.0 / 43.0-35.0 pts in the partnership, explore slam possibilities with Blackwood at 4 No Trump.
We bid 4NT.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 5D.
--------------------
West doubles.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 4 Hearts, 4 No Trump, and 5 Diamonds.
BK20: Partner responded to our 4NT Blackwood inquiry with 5 Diamonds, indicating 1 Ace.
BK32: Our team holds all four aces, so proceed to 5NT to ask for kings.
We bid 5NT.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 6H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 4.
BK40: Partner responded to our 4NT Blackwood inquiry with 6 Hearts, indicating 2 Kings.
BK49: Since we're missing 2 Kings and have a total of only 43.0-35.0 HCPs in the partnership, we lack sufficient strength for a grand slam and have to settle for a small slam at 6 No Trump.  <<<<<<<<<< NO 6H West openned in Diamonds!!!!!
We bid 6NT.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 6 No Trump.  Declarer is North; East leads.
