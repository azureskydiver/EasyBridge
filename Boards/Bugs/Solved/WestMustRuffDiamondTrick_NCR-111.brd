[[File Comments]]
West must ruff diamond trick to keep from going down.
>>>>>>>> WEST <<<<<<<<<<
PLNADJ: Reviewing play plan for round 5...
PLRV10: We have only 7 reasonably sure tricks left vs. 9 more trick(s) required for the contract.
PLSEQ: Checking play sequencing...
PLSEQ6: We want to work on developing the Club suit first, so move its plays up to the front if possible.
PINTLV: Interleaving plays...
PLYTRY: No usable plays found for the current situation.
PLAYDC2: Playing second in hand, using default player logic.
PLDC2B2: We can win the trick in dummy with the King, so discard the four here.  ?????????????? ACE IS STILL OUT??????????? RUFF
