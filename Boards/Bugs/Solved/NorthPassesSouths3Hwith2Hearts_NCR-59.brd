>>>>>>> NORTH <<<<<<<<
S:AQJ9872  H:AT  D:643  C:8
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 11.0, Distn pts = 3.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 14.0.
  QT's = 2.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H
  Probable Stoppers in:
  7 Likely Winners (6/1/0/0)
  6 Likely Losers (1/1/3/1)
Playing five-card majors, Spades can be opened.
Have a powerful suit in Spades.
Preferred suit is Spades.
====================
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
E07: Have 11.0 points in high cards in 3rd position and a powerful Spade suit, so bid 1 Spade.
We bid 1S.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Spade and partner's response of 2 Spades.
RDR0: With a single raise, partner is showing 6.0-10.0 points and decent (3-4 card) support for our Spade suit.
REVAL10: (with a 7-card trump suit in Spades, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 14.0 to 17.0 points)
R14: Using the modified trick count, we have 6 playing tricks in hand and a total of 23.0-27.0 points in the partnership, so show the Heart support suit in a bid of 3 Hearts.
We bid 3H.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 4H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
BXL05: Partner has bid yet another suit, Hearts.
BXL30: Although partner bid Hearts, we prefer to return to his previous Spade suit.
BXL36: Without the strength to push further at 23.0-27.0 total team points, pass and accept the contract of 4 Hearts.  <<<<< NO only 2????
We pass.   <<<<<<<<< 
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 4 Hearts.  Declarer is North; East leads.
