Since I was playing South, I should be glad E-W screwed up the bidding.
 
West opens a normal 1 Heart with a 6 card suit, 14 HCP and a singleton Spade.  (North-South pass throughout).  East considers a limit raise but decides he is too strong so he makes a temporizing bid of 1 Spade.  (I would also bid 1 Spade but for a different reason.  I require 4 card support with an honor for either a limit raise or Jacoby 2NT so I wouldn’t even consider a limit raise.)
 
West is now marginal to rebid 3 Hearts, but he decides on the more conservative 2 Hearts. (I would bid 3 Hearts but a singleton in partner’s Spade suit is a drawback.  My criteria for a jump rebid is a 6-card suit and 16-18 total points.)  At this point East really blows it by rebidding 2 Spades.  East-West have a minimum of an 8 card trump suit in Hearts and sufficient strength to go to game.  East must bid 4 Hearts right then – only he knows about the good Heart fit and combined strength.  (At the very least East could bid 3 Hearts instead.  It seems like East forgot the 1 Spade bid originally was just a temporizing bid.) West now thinks they have a real misfit so he passes 2 Spades.
 
East – West go down 2 at 2 Spades, but are cold for 5 Hearts, and with the Diamond King on-side the will make 6.
