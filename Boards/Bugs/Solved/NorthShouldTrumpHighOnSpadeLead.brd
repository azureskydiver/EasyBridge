North should have trumped trick with C9 or 10 to beat dummy's trump since dummy is void in spades......

Opening bid for team.
Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
But we lack the strength for a simple overcall.
We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.

--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Spade.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Spade suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
The total point count in the partnership is therefore 9.5-16.5 points.
This is not enough to bid any higher, so pass.
We pass.

Bidding finished; contract is 5 Clubs.  Declarer is West; North leads.
=======================
Starting play as left-hand defender.
Making opening lead as North against a contract of 5 Clubs.
Lead the top card of partner's Spade suit (the ten.
Play our only card in the suit, the two.
Dummy is now out of Spades.
Although we could trump this hand, partner's SJ is high, so discard the D4.
North is now known to have started with 2 Spades.
