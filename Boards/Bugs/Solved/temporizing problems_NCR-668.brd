[[File Comments]]
In this hand E-W should be playing in 3 or 4 Diamonds.  
East opens 1 Diamond with a good 5 card suit.  
West has good diamond support, but he feels too strong for a limit raise 
(my wife and I wouldn’t have the problem because we only play limit raises in the majors), 
so he temporizes with 2S.  East has 3-card support for spades so he bids 2 Spades.  
At this point East must reveal his diamond support, but instead bids 3 Spades.  
So E-W end up in a 3-3 trump fit for down 3.
