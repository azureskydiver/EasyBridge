  11 Eventual Winners (4/1/1/5)
  2 Possible Losers (vs. 1 allowable)
PLN10: We have only 11 sure tricks against a requirement of 12 for the 6S contract.
PLNDRP1: Looking at the hand for drop plays...
PLNDRP1: Can play the Ace of Clubs in dummy to try and drop the opponents' Queen.
PLNDRP5: One drop play is available.
PLNFNS0: Looking for possible finesses...
PLNFNS95: No immediate finesses have been found.
PLNDEV0: Looking for ways to force out enemy top cards and promote our own......
PLNDEV95: No suit development plays have been found.
PLNRF0: Looking for ruffing tricks...
PLNRF1: We can potentially ruff up to 2 Hearts in dummy.
PLNRF1: We can potentially ruff up to 3 Diamonds in dummy.
PLNRF5: Up to 5 ruffs can be used (5 in dummy/0 in hand) out of a total of 6 available.
PLNCSH1: Looking at the hand for cashes...
PLNCSH3: We can cash 5 cards in Clubs, plus 1 in Diamonds, plus 1 in Hearts, plus 4 in Spades.
PLNCSH30: A total of 11 maximum cashing tricks are immediately available. 3 require cards to have been played
PLNTRMP: Evaluating the trumps situation...
PLNTRMP5: We can safely play up to 1 round of trumps without endangering the contract.
PLNTRMP8: However, this may not pull in all 6 outstanding trump(s).
PLNTRMP9: This will result in  1 round of trumps, 6 cashing tricks in the side suits, and up to 5 ruffing tricks.
PLYSCN: Reviewing available plays...
PLTSTP: Checking logic of selected plays against play history...
PLNF1: Done examining plays...
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
PLNST90B: We have 18 possible plays and up to 13 possible tricks including 11 sure tricks (vs. 12 required) accounted for in the plan.
PLNPRI: The Club suit looks the most promising for further development.
PLSEQ: Checking play sequencing...
PLSEQ6: We want to work on developing the Club suit first, so move its plays up to the front if possible.
PLSEQ6a: moved up 5 plays using the Club suit.
PINTLV: Interleaving plays...
PINTLV10: Postpone the [CA Cash] so the suit winners in hand are cashed first, to avoid possible stranding.

------>
 Play 1: Pull a round of trumps with the two in dummy.
 Play 2: Play the CA from Dummy to try and drop the CQ.
 Play 3: Cash the King of Clubs in hand.
