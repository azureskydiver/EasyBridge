Very funny bidding to leave EW in 4C contract
At any rate East with such low count should leave the 3H bid or even raise to 4 but not name his pittiful club suit===================

Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 5.0, Distn pts = 3.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.0;
Total pts = 4.0.
  QT's = 1.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S
  Probable Stoppers in:
  3 Likely Winners (3/0/0/0)
  10 Likely Losers (2/2/1/5)
Playing five-card majors, Spades can be opened.
Preferred suit is Spades.
====================
South bids 1D.
--------------------
West doubles.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Partner has doubled for takeout.
Partner's takeout indicates 11.5+ HCPs, for a total in the partnership of 15.5-25.5 points.
With 5.0/4.0 pts, respond with our longest suit of Spades at a bid of 1 Spade.
We bid 1S.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 3H.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Spade and partner's response of 3 Hearts.
Partner bid 3 Hearts after his takeout and our 1 Spade response.
Partner has made a jump shift to 3 Hearts after our opening 1 Spade bid, which indicates 18.5+ points and is forcing to game (and points to a possible slam).
With weak support for partner's Hearts (holding 95) and no rebiddable suit, we have to show our strength by shifting to 4 Clubs.
We bid 4C.

Bidding finished; contract is 4 Clubs.  Declarer is East; South leads.

S:A83  H:AKQJ872  D:KJ  C:Q
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 20.0, Distn pts = 6.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.0;
Total pts = 22.0.
  QT's = 3.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  8 Likely Winners (0/7/1/0)
  5 Likely Losers (3/0/1/1)
Playing five-card majors, Hearts can be opened.
Have a powerful suit in Hearts.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
South bids 1D.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
With 20.0/22.0 points, the hand is too strong for a simple overcall, so start by doubling.
We bid Dbl.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 1S.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of Double and partner's response of 1 Spade.
Partner has made a minimum response of 1 Spade, indicating no more than 9 points.
The total point count in the partnership is therefore 24.0-31.0 pts.
Partner's forced response of 1 Spade not withstanding, we can now show the Heart suit that we wanted to overcall with last round by bidding 3 Hearts.
We bid 3H.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 4C.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Spade, 3 Hearts, and 4 Clubs.
With a total of only 24.0-31.0 pts in the partnership, and no agreement in suits, we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 4 Clubs.  Declarer is East; South leads.
