Bidding really went badly
Norm,
 
Somehow E-W really went wrong in the bidding.  It was not bad until West rebid his 3 card heart suit over 4 diamonds (with 3 card diamond help !).  Then East didn’t correct to his 9 card diamond suit over 4 hearts. Then, when 4 hearts was doubled, neither West nor East ran to 5 diamonds.   Down 7, doubled.
 
I think I can agree with East’s original takeout double, rather than a preempt because of his great playing strength in diamonds (maybe I would even start with a direct cue-bid of 2 spades).
 
By the way, that brings up another problem area.  EasyBridge seems to treat bids of opponents’ suit as natural instead of artificial and forcing showing great strength.  In fact, I don’t ever recall EasyBridge making a cue-bid.
