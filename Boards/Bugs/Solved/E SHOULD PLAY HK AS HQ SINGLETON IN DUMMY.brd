====================
West passes.
--------------------
North bids 1C.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
But we lack the strength for a simple overcall.
We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
South bids 1D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North bids 1NT.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.

Bidding finished; contract is 3 No Trump.  Declarer is North; East leads.
=======================
Starting play as left-hand defender.
Making opening lead as East against a contract of 3 No Trump.
Lead the fourth card from our best suit (Hearts) -- play the H5.
Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
Cover with the eight.
Dummy is now out of Hearts.
West is now known to have started with 1 Heart.
