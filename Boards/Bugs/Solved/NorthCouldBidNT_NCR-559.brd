>>>>>>> NORTH<<<<<<<<<<
S:KT98  H:KQJ9  D:A  C:KQ82
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 18.0, Distn pts = 2.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;

  7 Likely Winners (1/3/1/2)
  6 Likely Losers (3/1/0/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suits are  Clubs, Hearts
The best suit is Hearts.
====================
South bids 2D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Diamonds.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Diamond contract...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
RWKT: Partner made a weak 2-bid, showing a a 6+ card suit with 5.5-10.5 points, less than 4 cards in the other major, no voids, and no more than one singleton.
We have 18.0/18.0/18.0 points, for a partnership total of 23.5-28.5 points, so we are interested in game if a good fit can be found.
RWKT32: We have very poor support for partner's Diamond (holding A), and no good suit of our own, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 Diamonds.  Declarer is South; West leads.
