***Bidding restarted***
West bids 2H.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL3: But we lack the strength with 6.5 pts for a simple overcall.
B00: We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 2S.
--------------------
South doubles.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
A10: Responding to partner's opening double.
TKOTR: Partner has doubled for takeout.
TKOTR8: Partner's takeout indicates 11.5+ HCPs, for a total in the partnership of 18.0-28.0 points.
TKOTR20a: Our longest suit of Spades happens to be the enemy suit, so respond in the next-longest suit of Hearts.
We bid 3H.

East passes.
