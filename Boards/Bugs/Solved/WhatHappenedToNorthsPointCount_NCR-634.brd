Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 18.0, Distn pts = 2.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0; Total pts = 18.0.
  QT's = 4.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  7 Likely Winners (1/1/4/1)
  6 Likely Losers (3/1/1/1)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Have a strong suit in Diamonds.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
E01: Have 18.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Diamond.
We bid 1D.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Diamond and partner's response of 1 Heart.
B3U00: Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid, Hearts over Diamonds, which shows 5.5-17.5 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Heart contract...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
B3U68: With 2-card support for partner's Hearts (holding A6), 18.0/18.0/18.0 points, an unbalanced hand, and our primary Diamond suit not jump rebiddable, we have to show our strength by shifting to 1 Spade, regardless of that suit's strength.
We bid 1S.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2NT.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
BXPNTA: Partner bid Notrump, indicating a dislike for our Spade suit.
BXPNTJ: Partner jumped to a bid of 2 No Trump over our 1 Spade, indicating 13.0-22.0 points.
BXPNT4: Partner's 2 No Trump bid indicates a preference for NoTrump.
BXPNT5: With a total of 23.5-35.5 / 31.0-40.0 pts in the partnership, we lack adequate strength for a further raise beyond partner's 2 No Trump bid, so we have to pass.  ??????????????
We pass.
