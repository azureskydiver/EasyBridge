East should bid his clubs and not lead West in weak Hearts
>>>>>>> EAST<<<<<<<<<<
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 1C.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Club.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL5: Adding 3 point(s) for the 2 extra trump(s).
4REVAL21: Adjusting by 0 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 5-card Club trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Spades, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 9.0 to 13.0 points)
F00: Partner is showing 12.0-20.5 points and 2+ QT's.
I08: Have 11.0/9.0/13.0 points with 5-card support for partner's Clubs (holding KQJ82), which is too strong for a limit raise, so we have to temporarily shift to Hearts with a bid of 1 Heart.
We bid 1H.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 2H.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Club, 1 Heart, and 2 Hearts.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 5.
3REVAL8: Since the trump suit is only topped by a King, deduct 2 points.
2REVAL18: Declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract in Hearts from 9.0 down to 4.5 points)
B4H11: Partner made a single raise of our Heart suit, showing 12.0-16.0 points with 3+ trump cards.  <<<<<<<<<<<<< Our Heart suit is NOT REAL !!!!!!!!!!!
B4H18: With only 11.0/9.0/4.5 pts in hand, for a total in the partnership of 16.5-20.5 points, a game is unlikely, so pass.
We pass.
