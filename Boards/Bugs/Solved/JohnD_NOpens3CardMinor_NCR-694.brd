Something wrong with N's logic here:
"Opening bid for team.
Have 16.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
But with an openable 4-card Spade suit, prefer to open in the major instead of in No Trump.
Have 16.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Club."

It's just wrong to open a 3 card minor in preference to a 4 card major in ACOL (I have 4 card majors selected in bidding options).

>>>>>>>>>>NORTH with 4card Major<<<<<<<<<<
Starting play from restored game.

Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 16.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0; Total pts = 16.0.
  QT's = 3.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  6 Likely Winners (2/0/1/3)
  7 Likely Losers (2/2/3/0)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Spades.
===================
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
A00: Have 16.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
A04: But with an openable 4-card Spade suit, prefer to open in the major instead of in No Trump.
E01: Have 16.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Club.  <<<<  Major vs Clubs????
We bid 1C.

East passes.
