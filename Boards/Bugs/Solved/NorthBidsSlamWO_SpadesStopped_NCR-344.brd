Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Heart.

F00: Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
I08: Have 13.0/13.0/14.0 points with 3-card support for partner's Hearts (holding K93), which is too strong for a limit raise, so we have to temporarily shift to Diamonds with a bid of 2 Diamonds.
We bid 2D.

B4D20: With 13.0/13.0/14.0 pts in hand, for a total in the partnership of 31.0-35.0 pts, we have the points to make game or possibly slam, but so far with no agreed on suit.
BLKWD: with 13.0/13.0/14.0 points in the hand, for a total of approx. 30.0-34.0 / 31.0-35.0 pts in the partnership, explore slam possibilities with Blackwood at 4 No Trump.
