Norm,
 
This hand has bad bidding combined with terrible declarer play.
 
With a 9 card Heart suit with 150 honors West decides to open 1 Heart.  I say with 1 trick short of game in your hand open 2 Clubs. North overcalls 2 diamonds, East and South pass, then West jumps to 3 Hearts, East bids 3 NT, and West raises to 4 NT.  (What’s wrong with 4 Hearts ?  The hand makes 5 Hearts.)
 
Even so, unless N-S cash their 4 tricks, it will make.  Indeed, with a Diamond lead, North cashes his 3 top Diamonds, and then leads a fourth Diamond.  Somehow East decides to discard low Hearts instead of clubs from dummy !  With the Jack of Diamonds plus 9 sure Heart tricks, he makes the contract unless North shifts to a club.  As it was East went down 5 !
