PL02: Starting play as left-hand defender.
PLYLEAD: Making opening lead as East against a contract of 4 Clubs.
PLYLD17: Lead the S8 Top of doubleton.
PLAYDF2: Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
PLDF2E: North led an honor (the ten), so cover it with our Ace.
PLYLD42: With no good card to lead, lead the S3 since the opponents have not shown out of the Spade suit.
PLYSIG1: Partner discarded low with the five, so consider it a signal that he dislikes the suit.
PLAYDF2: Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
PLDF2H3: Cover with the Queen.  <<<<<<<<<<<<???  Dmy has singleton CK
