====================
South bids 1S.
--------------------
West bids 2H.

Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Spade.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL5: Adding 1 point(s) for the 1 extra trump(s).
2REVAL38: (with 4-card Spade trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Hearts, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 11.0 to 13.0 points)
F00: Partner is showing 12.0-21.5 points and 2+ QT's.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 5.
2REVAL18: Declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract in Spades from 11.0 down to 10.0 points)
I08: Have 11.0/11.0/13.0 points with 4-card support for partner's Spades (holding A875), which is too strong for a limit raise, so we have to temporarily shift to Diamonds with a bid of 3 Diamonds.  <<<<<<<<<???
We bid 3D.

Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Spade, 3 Diamonds, and 4 Diamonds.
B4H14: Partner made a single raise of our 3 Diamonds bid to 4 Diamonds, showing 15.0 -21.5 points and 3+ trump cards.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL5: Adding 1 point(s) for the 1 extra trump(s).
2REVAL38: (with 4-card Spade trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Hearts, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 11.0 to 13.0 points)
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 5.
3REVAL8: Since the trump suit is only topped by a ten, deduct 3 points.
2REVAL18: Declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract in Diamonds from 11.0 down to 7.0 points)
B4H35: We have a total of approx. 25.0-34.5 in the partnership, but we do not have a rebiddable suit, nor do we have enough stoppers for a NT contract, so we have to sign off on partner's 4 Diamonds bid.
We pass.    <<<<<<<<<<< NO Back to Spades <<<<<<<<<
--------------------
East passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 4 Diamonds.  Declarer is North; East leads.
