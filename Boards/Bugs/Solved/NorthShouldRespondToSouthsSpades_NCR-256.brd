The best suit is Hearts.
====================
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 1D.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVERCL8: Have a good 5-card Heart suit with 14.5/14.5 points and 7 playing tricks, so overcall the opponents' 1 Diamond with a bid of 1 Heart.
We bid 1H.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Heart and partner's response of 1 Spade.
OVRRB22: Partner bid his own Spades suit at the 1 level in response to our 1 Heart overcall, indicating 6+ cards and approx. 8.0-11.0 points.
YN1: With 22.5-25.5 points in the partnership and 4-card support for partner's major Spade suit (holding KJ87), raise to 2 Spades.
OVRRB80: With a lack of better options, we begrudgingly raise partner to the 2-level with 4 at a bid of 2 Spades.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< YES
OVRRB88: As we lack agreement in suits and have only 22.5-25.5 team points, we have no good options other than to pass.  <<<<<<<<<<< NO
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 1 Spade.  Declarer is South; West leads.
