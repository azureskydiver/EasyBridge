Why did North play D5?
>>>>>>>NORTH<<<<<<<
S:A97  H:Q  D:QJT74  C:AQ85
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 15.0, Distn pts = 2.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.0; Total pts = 14.0.
  QT's = 2.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  6 Likely Winners (1/0/3/2)
  7 Likely Losers (2/1/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suits are  Clubs, Diamonds
The best suit is Diamonds.
====================
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
E01: Have 15.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Diamond.
We bid 1D.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Diamond and partner's response of 1 Heart.
B3U00a: Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid after an earlier pass, Hearts over Diamonds, which shows 5.5-11.5 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Heart contract...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
2REVAL70: Dummy's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 14.0 to 14.0 points.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer for Diamond contract...
3REVAL8: Since the trump suit is only topped by a Queen, deduct 1 points.
2REVAL16: (after re-evaluation for distribution, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 14.0 to 15.0 points)
B3U22: With a rebiddable Diamond suit and insufficient support for partner's Hearts (holding Q), rebid at 2 Diamonds.
We bid 2D.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
BXM70: Partner switched suits again, which forces us to bid again -- so with no other good options, bid 3 No Trump.
We bid 3NT.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 No Trump.  Declarer is North; East leads.

 Play 3: Play the CK from Dummy to try and drop the CJ.
 Play 4: Play the Queen of Spades from dummy to force out the opponents' King.

 Play 6: Lead the Spade Jack from dummy and finesse it, with the Ace in hand as cover.
 Play 7: Lead the Spade Queen from dummy and finesse it, with the Ace in hand as cover.
 Play 8: Lead the Diamond Jack from hand and finesse it, with the Ace in dummy as cover.

PLFRC12: Play the D3 from dummy to force out the opponents' King.
PLFRC64: We're in the opposite hand of a force play, so discard the D4.
