N's logic goes wrong - "N/A support for partner's ???? suit".
N should bid 4H over S's Dbl.


=====================================
Received hand:
  S:A653  H:J9532  D:K7  C:J7
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 9.0, Distn pts = 2.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-0.5;
Total pts = 8.5.
  QT's = 1.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  4 Likely Winners (1/2/1/0)
  9 Likely Losers (3/3/1/2)
Preferred suit is Spades.
====================
Opening bid for team.
Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 4D.
--------------------
South doubles.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening double.
Partner, opening in fourth position, is showing 10.0-22.0 points and 2+ QT's.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer for Heart contract...
3REVAL5: Adding 1 point(s) for the 1 extra trump(s).
3REVAL8: Since the trump suit is only topped by a Jack, deduct 2 points.
2REVAL10: (with a 5-card trump suit in Hearts, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 8.5 to 9.5 points)
We have 9.0/8.5/8.5 points with N/A support for partner's ???? suit (holding ) and no good major of our own, so bid 1NT.
But our bid (1 No Trump) is too low vs. the last bid of of 4 Diamonds, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 4 Diamonds (doubled).  Declarer is East; South leads.
