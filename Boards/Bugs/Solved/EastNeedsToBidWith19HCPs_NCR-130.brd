S:AJ9  H:KJ5  D:AQ4  C:KJT4
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 19.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 19.0.
  QT's = 3.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  6 Likely Winners (1/1/2/2)
  7 Likely Losers (2/2/1/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
South bids 1NT.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL6a: But we don't have a suit strong enough to overcall with at the 2-level.
A00: Have 19.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
A10: This exceeds the max pts for a 1NT opening (17), but is less than min pts for 2NT (20).  So bid the lowest openable suit of 1 Club for now, then try for a jump shift to 2NT later.
But our bid (1 Club) is too low vs. the last bid of of 1 No Trump, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 1 No Trump.  Declarer is South; West leads.

***Bidding restarted***
South bids 1D.
--------------------
West bids 2S.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Spades.
REVAL38: (with 3-card Spade trump support including a trump honor, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 19.0 to 20.0 points)
ROVRC3: Partner made a weak jump overcall of 2 Spades, indicating 5.5-9.5 pts and a good 6+ card Spade suit.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 25.5-29.5 points.
YN1: With 25.5-29.5 points in the partnership and 3-card support for partner's major Spade suit (holding AJ9), raise to 4 Spades.
We bid 4S.
