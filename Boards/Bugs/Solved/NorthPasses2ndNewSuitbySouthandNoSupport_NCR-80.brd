3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
With poor support for partner's Heart suit (holding 7), and a second openable suit in Spades (holding AJ762), show it in a 1 Spade bid.

Rebidding in round 3.
Partner bid Notrump, indicating a dislike for our Spade suit.
Partner jumped to a bid of 3 No Trump over our 1 Spade, indicating 13.0-22.0 points.
With a total of 18.5-30.5 / 27.0-36.0 pts in the partnership, we lack adequate strength for a further raise beyond partner's 3 No Trump bid, so we have to pass.
We pass.
