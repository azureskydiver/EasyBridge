====================
***Bidding restarted***
Opening bid for team.
Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North bids 1D.
--------------------
East doubles.
--------------------
South bids 1H.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening double.
TKOTR: Partner has doubled for takeout.
TKORT8: Partner's takeout indicates 11.0+ HCPs, for a total in the partnership of 16.0-26.0 points.
TKOTR12: But Right-hand opponent has bid after partner's double, so the takeout is no longer in effect.
TKOTR14: However, assuming partner has 12+ HCPs, that amount combined with our 5.0/5.0 points totals 17.0/17.0 pts, which is enough for us to bid 1 Spade.
We bid 1S.   <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< Freebid with 5 HCPs ???
--------------------
North bids 2H.

East bids 3S.
