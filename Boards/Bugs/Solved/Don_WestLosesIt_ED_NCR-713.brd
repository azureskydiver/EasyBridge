[[File Comments]]
A strange hand where E-W should end in 4 Hearts, but instead play in a 2-1 fit at 5 clubs.
 
North opens a normal 1 Club, East bids 2 NT (unusual, showing Hearts and Diamonds), South passes, West cue bids 3 Clubs, North passes, East responds weakly by bidding 3 diamonds (the lower of his two suits), South passes, now for some reason West thinks that East has responded in the HIGHER of the two suits showing a strong hand and then bids 5 Clubs, not the indicated 4 Hearts.  I have no idea why 5 clubs was bid – clearly West had lost all track of what was going on.
