>>>>>>>>>NORTH<<<<<
S:64  H:T965  D:853  C:AKJ9
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 8.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0; Total pts = 8.0.
  QT's = 2.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  3 Likely Winners (0/0/0/3)
  10 Likely Losers (2/4/3/1)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
West bids 2NT.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL3: But we lack the strength with 8.0 pts for a simple overcall.
B00: We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 6NT.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.  <<<<<<<<<<<<No Double
We pass.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 6 No Trump.  Declarer is West; North leads.
=======================
PL02: Starting play as left-hand defender.
PLYLEAD: Making opening lead as North against a contract of 6 No Trump.
PLYLDS3: We may be able to defeat the contract by playing two Aces, so lead them starting with the shortest suit -- lead the CA first.
PLYSIG1: Partner discarded low with the four, so consider it a signal that he dislikes the suit.
PLCSW9: With no other good options, cash a winner in the Club suit, the King
PLYLDS6e: Try to defeat the contract now by playing the CK.
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Clubs.
PLYSIG8: Partner discarded high with the five after discarding the four last round, thus marking a low-high signal for a poor suit.
PLYLDB: With no other clear plays available, lead a card from the unbid Spade suit.
