On this deal
   B2F1E5FFC
E should end up in 1NT.

Lead a club, and discard all spades later, to leave you with AH and QxC. North will lead a H to you, which you take with the A and claim the last two tricks (only clubs left).

The trick count goes from 2-9 to 2-11, whereas it should go to 4-9.

It looks as though "Claim remaining tricks" assigns them all to declarer, even when the defenders are claiming them.
