[[File Comments]]
====================================================================================
West opened 1D, North bid 1S and East bid 2S. East would expect that North, with overcall of 1S probably has 5 spades so a bid of 2S is pretty risky..................
=============================================
East analsysis"
S:AJT9  H:72  D:K74  C:JT94
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 9.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0; Total pts = 9.0.
  QT's = 1.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  4 Likely Winners (2/0/1/1)
  9 Likely Losers (2/2/2/3)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Spades.
====================
Opening bid for team.
Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 1D.
--------------------
North bids 1S.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Diamond.
(with 3-card Diamond trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Hearts, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 9.0 to 11.0 points)
Partner, opening in third position, is showing 10.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
Have 9.0/9.0/11.0 points but prefer not to raise a minor, so bid our 4-card major Spade suit instead at 2 Spades.
We bid 2S.<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<========================= BUT NORTH HAD BID 1S so probably not a good bid!!!<================
