South's hint was to pass with 14HCPs ??
>>>>>>>>>>  SOUTH <<<<<<<<<<
S:J93  H:AK96  D:AQ754  C:8
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 14.0, Distn pts = 2.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-0.5;
Total pts = 13.5.
  QT's = 3.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Likely Winners (0/2/3/0)
  8 Likely Losers (3/2/2/1)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suits are  Diamonds, Hearts
The best suit is Diamonds.
====================
West bids 1C.
--------------------
North bids 1H.
--------------------
East bids 1S.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Heart.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 5.
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Heart suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 20.5-27.5 points.
ROVRC99: We have insufficient strength for either a raise, suit shift, or NT bid, so pass.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<????????????  NO Have 4 GOOD Hearts
