East opens 1 Diamond.  Why not 1 Club ?

Norm,
 
I do not understand why East opens 1 Diamond instead of 1 Club.
 
Some people will always bid clubs (if they are 4-4 in the majors and 2-3 in the minors, or if they are 4-3 in the majors and 3-3 in the minors) and are opening a minimum hand.  This means they will sometimes open a 2 card club suit.
 
Other people (like me) prefer to bid the longer minor (or the better one with equal length) in that situation.  This avoids opening a 2 card suit.
 
From this hand it looks like EasyBridge picks the minor with the most HCP, even if it means opening a 2-card diamond suit.  Do you support this approach, or is it just something inherited from the old version ?
 
Don
