[[File Comments]]
North's bid of 1S over 1C is questionable - I'd much prefer a double. His bid of a three card badly misled me about his hand shape.

S:AQ6  H:AQ3  D:AJ8  C:T752
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 17.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 17.0.
  QT's = 4.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  2 Likely Winners (1/1/1/-1)
  11 Likely Losers (2/2/2/5)
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 1C.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
But we lack the strength with 17.0 pts for a simple overcall.
Have 17.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
This exceeds the max pts for a 1NT opening (14), but is less than min pts for 2NT (22 and we have no good openable suit, so just bid 1 Spade for now.
We bid 1S.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 4S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Spade and partner's response of 4 Spades.
With a triple raise, partner is showing 5 trumps and 6.0-9.0 HCPs, and expects us to sign off at game.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 4.
2REVAL18: Declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract in Spades from 17.0 down to 15.0 points)
With 21.0-24.0 total partnership points, we have to agree and pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 4 Spades.  Declarer is North; East leads.
