***Bidding restarted***
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 2H.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL6a: But we don't have a suit strong enough to overcall with at the 3-level.
TKOUT: With 20.0/20.0 points and support for all unbid suits, bid a takeout double.
We bid Dbl.
--------------------
East bids 3H.
--------------------
South bids 3S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of Double and partner's response of 3 Spades.
TKORb42: Partner has made a jump/freebid response of 3 Spades, indicating 10-12 pts and a 4-5 card suit.
TKRb49: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 30.0-32.0 pts.
TKRb72: With a total of 30.0-32.0 points in the partnership, we have insufficient strength to raise partner's 3 Spades bid, so we have to pass. <<<<<<<<<<<<<????
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Spades.  Declarer is South; West leads.
