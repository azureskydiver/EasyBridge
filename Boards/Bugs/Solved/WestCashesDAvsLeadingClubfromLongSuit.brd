[[File Comments]]
West leads the singletonDA against a 3NT contract with 7 clubs.  He should lead a club!!!
PLCSW9:  With no other good options, cash a winner in the Diamond suit, the Ace.
PLYLD84: With no other obvious plays, cash a winner with the DA.
>>> Above fixed !!! New problem: East does NOT return Clubs to West. He leads Spades for South.
PLYLD76: Continue developing our Spade suit by playing the S8.
