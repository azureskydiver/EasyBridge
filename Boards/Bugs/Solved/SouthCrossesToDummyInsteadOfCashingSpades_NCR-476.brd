South leads Trumps when there are NO trumps outstanding.  Should cash Spades
>>>>>>> SOUTH<<<<<<<<<

PLRV11: We have 5 reasonably sure tricks left vs. 5 more trick(s) required for the contract.
PLNDRP1: Looking at the hand for drop plays...
PLNDRP5: No drop plays are available.
PLNFNS0: Looking for possible finesses...

PLNDEV95: No suit development plays have been found.
PLNRF0: Looking for ruffing tricks...
PLNRF1: We can potentially ruff up to 1 Club in hand.
PLNCSH1: Looking at the hand for cashes...
PLNCSH3: We can cash 1 card in Hearts, plus 3 in Spades 1 in Clubs.
PLNCSH30: A total of 5 maximum cashing tricks are immediately available. 1 require cards to have been played
PLNTRMP: Evaluating the trumps situation...
PLNTRMP5: We can safely play up to 1 round of trumps without endangering the contract.
PLNTRMP6: However, we only need to pull a maximum of 0 rounds to collect all the outstanding trumps.
PLNTRMP9: This will result in (up to) 0 rounds of trumps, 4 cashing tricks in the side suits, and up to 1 ruffing trick.
PLYSCN: Reviewing available plays...
PLTSTP: Checking logic of selected plays against play history...
PLNF1: Done examining plays...
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
PLNST90A: We have 6 possible plays and approx. 6+ possible tricks including 5 sure tricks (vs. 8 required) accounted for in the plan.
PLNPRI: The Club suit looks the most promising for further development.
PLN00: The unsorted list of available plays is as follows:
------>
 Play 1: Ruff a Club in hand.
 Play 2: Cash the Eight of Hearts in dummy.
 Play 3: Cash the King of Spades in hand.
 Play 4: Cash the Jack of Spades in hand.
 Play 5: Cash the Ten of Spades in hand.
 Play 6: Cash the Jack of Clubs in dummy. <Requires ...>
PLSEQ: Checking play sequencing...
PLSEQ3: Since we have enough sure tricks (5) to fulfill the contract, we moved 4 cash plays forward
PINTLV: Interleaving plays...
PINTLV35: Add plan to cross over to dummy by playing Jack of Diamonds.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< NO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
PINTLV50: The cash of the ST can only be used here in the hand since there are no lead cards in the opposite hand -- so move up the play.
PINTLV50: The cash of the SJ can only be used here in the hand since there are no lead cards in the opposite hand -- so move up the play.
PINTLV50: The cash of the SK can only be used here in the hand since there are no lead cards in the opposite hand -- so move up the play.
