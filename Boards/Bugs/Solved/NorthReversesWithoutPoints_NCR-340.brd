  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D, C

Playing five-card majors, Hearts can be opened.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
Opening bid for team.
A00: Have 14.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
A02: But with an openable 5-card Heart suit, prefer to open in the major instead of in No Trump.
E01: Have 14.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Heart.
We bid 1H.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Heart and partner's response of 2 Hearts.
RDR0: With a single raise, partner is showing 6.0-10.0 points and decent (3-4 card) support for our Heart suit.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
2REVAL16: (after re-evaluation for distribution, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 14.0 to 15.0 points)
R14: Using the modified trick count, we have 4 playing tricks in hand and a total of 21.0-25.0 points in the partnership, so show the Spade support suit in a bid of 2 Spades.
We bid 2S.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< Doesn't have points for Reverse

East passes.
