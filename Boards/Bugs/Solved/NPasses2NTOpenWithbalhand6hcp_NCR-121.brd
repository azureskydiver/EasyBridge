  10 Likely Losers (3/2/2/3)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
Opening bid for team.
Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.

East passes.

South bids 2NT.

West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 No Trump.
Partner made a strong 2-bid, showing a very good suit or two solid suits, 9+ playing tricks, and 4+ quick tricks.  We have to respond positively if interested in slam, or negatively otherwise.
But with only 0.5 QT's, we have to make the negative response of 2 No Trump to deny slam values.
But 2 No Trump has already been bid, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 No Trump.  Declarer is South; West leads.
