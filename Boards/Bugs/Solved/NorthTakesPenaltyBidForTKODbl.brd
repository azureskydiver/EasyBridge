====================
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 1NT.
--------------------
South bids 2H.
--------------------
West bids 3NT.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Hearts.
REVAL38: (with 3-card Heart trump support & a doubleton in Spades,  & a singleton in Clubs, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 0.0 to 4.0 points)
ROVRC5: Partner overcalled at the 2-level, indicating a good 5+ card Heart suit, 9.0-14.0 points, and probably 6+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 13.0-18.0 points.
ROVRC10: This is not enough to bid any higher, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
