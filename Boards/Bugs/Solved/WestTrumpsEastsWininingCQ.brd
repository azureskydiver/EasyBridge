Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.

North bids 1D.
--------------------
East bids 2C.
--------------------
South bids 2S.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Clubs.
ROVRC5: Partner overcalled at the 2-level, indicating a good 5+ card Club suit, 9.0-14.0 points, and probably 6+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 14.0-19.0 points.
ROVRC10: This is not enough to bid any higher, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North bids 4S.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 4 Spades.  Declarer is South; West leads.
=======================
PL02: Starting play as left-hand defender.
PLYLEAD: Making opening lead as West against a contract of 4 Spades.
PLYLD4: Lead the singleton C5.
PLAYB47: Partner's Ace can win the trick, so discard the S4.
PLDF55: With no cards in Clubs, trump with the SQ. <<<<<<<<<<<< NO winning card is partner's
RCP5A: West is now known to have started with 1 Club.
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Clubs.
