  Sure Stoppers in: D, C

Preferred suits are  Clubs, Diamonds
The best suit is Clubs.
====================
South bids 1C.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL6: But we don't have a sufficiently strong overcall suit.
B00: We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.  <<<<<<<<<<<<????? With 15HCPs???????
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 1S.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
B00 Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Spade.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Spade contract...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Spade suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 22.5-29.5 points.
ROVRC99: We have insufficient strength for either a raise, suit shift, or NT bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 1 Spade.  Declarer is East; South leads.
