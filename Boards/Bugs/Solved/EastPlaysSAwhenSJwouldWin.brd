[[File Comments]]
East plays SA after dummy (dummy has SK, East has SAQJ)
>>> SJ would win the trick
PLDF40: Play high with the Ace.
...New problem: West leads DT and follows next trick with D6 signaling OUT!!!
East leads SA and then SQ to dummy's SK.
East should have lead a diamond!!!  
Is West's signal recognized???
