====================
South bids 1NT.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North bids 2C.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVERCL8: Have a good 5-card Diamond suit with 11.0/11.0 points and 6 playing tricks, so overcall the opponents' 2 Clubs with a bid of 2 Diamonds.
We bid 2D.
--------------------
South bids 2S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North bids 4S.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 2 Diamonds and partner's pass.
We pass.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 4 Spades.  Declarer is South; West leads.
=======================
PL03: Starting play as right-hand defender.
PLDF37: Partner's five might not win the round, so top it with the Queen.
PLYLDRT2: We'd like to return partner's Diamonds suit, but dummy will most likely win.
PLCSW9: With no other good options, cash a winner in the Diamond suit, the Ace
PLYSIG1: Partner discarded low with the two, so consider it a signal that he dislikes the suit.
PLYLD43: With no good card to lead, lead the HK since dummy is not void in the Heart suit (we don't know about declarer, though).
PLYSIG1: Partner discarded low with the two, so consider it a signal that he dislikes the suit.
PLAYB48: We can't beat North's King, so discard the S4.
PLAYDF2: Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
PLDF2H2: As second hand, play the lowest card we have in the suit, the seven.
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Hearts.
PLAYB55: With no cards in Hearts, trump with the SJ.
RCP5A: East is now known to have started with 1 Heart.
PLYLDD: With no other obvious plays, play CK.  <<<<<<<<<<<<< NO<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< How about a diamond
PLYSIG0: Partner discarded high with the Jack, so consider it a suit preference signal.
