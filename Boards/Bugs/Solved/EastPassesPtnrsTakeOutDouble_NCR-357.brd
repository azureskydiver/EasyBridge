  QT's = 1.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  3 Likely Winners (0/0/1/2)
  10 Likely Losers (2/3/2/3)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
South bids 1C.
--------------------
West doubles.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Partner has doubled for takeout.
Partner's takeout indicates 11.5+ HCPs, for a total in the partnership of 18.5-28.5 points.
Our longest suit of Clubs happens to be the enemy suit, and we don't have a decent alternate suit, nor do we have the 13+ pts required to cue-bid the enemy suit, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 1 Club (doubled).  Declarer is South; West leads.
