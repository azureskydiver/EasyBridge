Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL6a: But we don't have a suit strong enough to overcall with at the 3-level.
TKOUT: With 18.0/16.5 points and support for all unbid suits, bid a takeout double.
We bid Dbl.

Rebidding after opening bid of Double and partner's response of 4 Clubs.
TKORb42: Partner has made a jump/freebid response of 4 Clubs, indicating 10-12 pts and a 4-5 card suit.
TKRb49: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 26.5-28.5 pts.
TKRb72: With a total of 26.5-28.5 points in the partnership, we have insufficient strength to raise partner's 4 Clubs bid, so we have to pass.  <<<<<<<<<<<< NO bid 4H
We pass.
