[[File Comments]]
North opens a natural 1S.  West, with an opening hand, and at least 3 card support for the unbid suits bids a take-out double (some people would insist on 4 cards in the unbid major if the opening bid was a major).  South passes, and West is faced with a real problem.  West has 11 HCP, so he should make a non-minimum response.  That would mean bidding 3C or 3D on 4 card suits.  Notrump is ruled out by the Queen douleton spade holding.  With only 3 Hearts to the King, he decides on a minimum heart response of 2H.  There are two things wrong with this decision: 1.  With 11 HCP he is much too strong for a minimum response, and 2.  He has 2 four card minor suits.  He should bid 3C.  East then should bid 3D and West should pass that.
 
With the 2H contract, West was down 3.
