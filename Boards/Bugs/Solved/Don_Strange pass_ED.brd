In this hand North with a 6 card heart suit and 17 HCP opens a normal 1H.  If South responds 2H, then North jumps to 4H and it makes 5.  All very normal.  However, if South makes a temporizing bid of 1S instead of 2H, then North passes !  (Even though in his analysis he recognizes 1S as a forcing bid.)  Now I realize 2H by South is the better bid for this weakish holding, but for all North knows South could have 18 points for his 1S bid, and a small slam would not be out of the question.

West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Heart and partner's response of 1 Spade.
B3U00: Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid, Spades over Hearts, which shows 5.5-17.5 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Spade contract...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
2REVAL70: Dummy's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 18.0 down to 16.5 points.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer for Heart contract...
3REVAL5: Adding 1 point(s) for the 1 extra trump(s).
2REVAL10: (with a 6-card trump suit in Hearts, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 18.0 to 20.0 points)
But our bid (1 Heart) is too low vs. the last bid of of 1 Spade, so we have to pass.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<NOTE
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 1 Spade.  Declarer is South; West leads.
