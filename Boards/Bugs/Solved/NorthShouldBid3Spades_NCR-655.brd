  QT's = 1.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D

Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
Opening bid for team.
Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1S.
--------------------
West bids 2C.
--------------------
B00 Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Spade.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Spade contract...
3REVAL5: Adding 1 point(s) for the 1 extra trump(s).
4REVAL21: Adjusting by 1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 4-card Spade trump support including a trump honor & a singleton in Clubs, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 9.0 to 14.0 points)
F01: Partner, opening in third position, is showing 10.0-20.5 points and 2+ QT's.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer for Heart contract...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 5.
I08: Have 9.0/9.0/14.0 points with 4-card support for partner's Spades (holding Q765), which is too strong for a limit raise, so we have to temporarily shift to Hearts with a bid of 2 Hearts.
We bid 2H.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Spade, 2 Hearts, and 3 Hearts.
B4H14: Partner made a single raise of our 2 Hearts bid to 3 Hearts, showing 12.0 -20.5 points and 3+ trump cards.
B4H35: We have a total of approx. 24.0-34.5 in the partnership, but we do not have a rebiddable suit, nor do we have enough stoppers for a NT contract, so we have to sign off on partner's 3 Hearts bid.
We pass.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<   NO Back to pards Spades
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Hearts.  Declarer is North; East leads.
