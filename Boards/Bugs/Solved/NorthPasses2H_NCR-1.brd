South bids 1S.
--------------------
West bids 2C.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Spade.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
F00: Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
G64: We have 9.0/7.5/7.5 points with poor support for partner's Spade suit (holding K9) and not enough strength for a 2/1 response to show our Diamond suit, so bid 1NT.
But our bid (1 No Trump) is too low vs. the last bid of of 2 Clubs, so we have to pass.
We pass.

East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Spade, Pass, and 2 Hearts.

We pass.
