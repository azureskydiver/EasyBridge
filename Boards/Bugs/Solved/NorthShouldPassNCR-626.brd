Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 No Trump, 2 Spades, and 3 No Trump.
JC16: Partner replied to our Jacoby transfer with a jump/overcall response of 3 No Trump, indicating max 1NT opening points (17) and 4+ trumps, for a total partnership holding of 23.0-23.0 points and 4+ trumps.
JC18: We instructed partner to bid Clubs last time because we're not playing 4-suit transfers, so we now want to correct to Diamonds.
JC20: With 6.0/6.0/6.0 points in the hand, and a total in the partnership of 23.0-23.0 points, settle for a part score and correct to 4 Diamonds.
