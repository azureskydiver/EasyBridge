Looks like a bug in the software logic here!
N should open 1H, not 1S.

North:
S:AKJ  H:KJT7  D:J63  C:A54
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 17.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-0.5;
Total pts = 16.5.
  QT's = 3.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  4 Likely Winners (2/2/0/0)
  9 Likely Losers (1/2/3/3)
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Have 17.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
But with an openable 4-card Heart suit, prefer to open in the major instead of in No Trump.
Have 17.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Spade.
We bid 1S.
--------------------
East doubles.
--------------------
South bids 2S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Spade and partner's response of 2 Spades.
With a single raise, partner is showing 6.0-10.0 points and decent (3-4 card) support for our Spade suit.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer for Spade contract...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 4.
2REVAL18: Declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract in Spades from 16.5 down to 14.5 points)
We have a total of 20.5-24.5 points in the partnership, which is not enough for game, so settle for a part score and pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 Spades.  Declarer is North; East leads.
