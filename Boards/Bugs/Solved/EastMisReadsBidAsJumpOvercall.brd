East thinks West did a Jump when he only overcalled.  See ROVRC3:
>>>>>> EAST <<<<<<<<
S:Q9  H:QJT4  D:T752  C:K85
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 8.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-2.0;
Total pts = 6.0.
  QT's = 0.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  3 Likely Winners (0/2/0/1)
  10 Likely Losers (2/2/4/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
North bids 1NT.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL3: But we lack the strength for a simple overcall.
B00: We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 2D.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Diamonds.
REVAL38: (with 4-card Diamond trump support & a doubleton in Spades, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 6.0 to 9.0 points)
ROVRC3: Partner made a weak jump overcall of 2 Diamonds, indicating 5.0-9.0 pts and a good 6+ card Diamond suit.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 14.0-18.0 points.
ROVRC20: This is insufficient to raise partner, so pass.
We pass.
