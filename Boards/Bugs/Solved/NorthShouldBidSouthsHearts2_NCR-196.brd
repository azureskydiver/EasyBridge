>>>>>>>> NORTH<<<<<<<<<<<
S:T54  H:AJT6  D:Q96  C:K82
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 10.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 10.0.
  QT's = 1.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  4 Likely Winners (0/2/1/1)
  9 Likely Losers (3/2/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1H.
--------------------
West bids 1S.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Heart.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL5: Adding 1 point(s) for the 1 extra trump(s).
2REVAL38: (with 4-card Heart trump support including a trump honor, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 10.0 to 12.0 points)
F00: Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
I08: Have 10.0/10.0/12.0 points with 4-card support for partner's Hearts (holding AJT6), which is too strong for a limit raise, so we have to temporarily shift to Clubs with a bid of 2 Clubs.
We bid 2C.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3C.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Heart, 2 Clubs, and 3 Clubs.

3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 5.
2REVAL18: Declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 10.0 down to 6.0 points)
B4H14: Partner made a single raise of our 2 Clubs bid to 3 Clubs, showing 12.0 -20.0 points and 3+ trump cards.
B4H30: With only 10.0/10.0/6.0 pts in hand, for a total in the partnership of 18.0-26.0 points, a game is unlikely, so pass.  <<<<<<<< NO GO BAD TO HEARTS
We pass.
