Looking at the hand for drop plays...
No drop plays are available.

Checking logic of selected plays against play history...
Done examining plays...
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
We have 7 plays and approx. 5+ possible tricks including 0 sure tricks (vs. 9 required) accounted for in the plan.
Checking play sequencing...
Since we have enough cashing tricks (2) to fulfill the contract, we can just proceed with the cashing.
Interleaving plays...
Postpone the CQ Cash so the suit winners in hand are cashed first, to avoid possible stranding.
