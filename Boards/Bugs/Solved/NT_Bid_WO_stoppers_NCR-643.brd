N bid 2NT without stoppers in unbid suit (in fact had a singleton)
==============
North Analysis
==============
S:K84  H:AKJ  D:QJ9732  C:9
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 14.0, Distn pts = 2.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 14.0.
  QT's = 2.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  6 Likely Winners (0/2/4/0)
  7 Likely Losers (3/1/2/1)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Have 14.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Diamond.
We bid 1D.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Diamond and partner's response of 1 Spade.
Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid, Spades over Diamonds, which shows 5.5-17.5 points and is forcing for one round.
Adjusting by 1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Spade trump support including a trump honor & a singleton in Clubs, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 14.0 to 17.0 points)
With 3-card support for partner's Spades (holding K84), 14.0/14.0/17.0 points, an unbalanced hand, our primary Diamond suit not jump rebiddable, and no second suit available, bid 2NT.
We bid 2NT.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3NT.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
With a total of 19.5-31.5 / 22.5-34.5 pts in the partnership, we lack adequate strength for a further raise beyond partner's 3 No Trump bid, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 No Trump.  Declarer is North; East leads.
