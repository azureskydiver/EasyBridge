North SHOULD NOT Pass when I gave a different suit... he forced the issue with his early double.
=========

S:AKQ87  H:KQ65  D:  C:KQT8
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 19.0, Distn pts = 3.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;

  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  9 Likely Winners (5/2/0/2)
  4 Likely Losers (0/2/0/2)
Playing five-card majors, Spades can be opened.

====================

--------------------
West bids 1D.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
With 19.0/19.0 points, the hand is too strong for a simple overcall, so start by doubling.
We bid Dbl.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1H.
--------------------
West doubles.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 2.
Partner has made a minimum response of 1 Heart, indicating no more than 9 points.
The total point count in the partnership is therefore 21.0-28.0 pts.
Partner's forced response of 1 Heart not withstanding, we can now show the Spade suit that we wanted to overcall with last round by bidding 1 Spade.
We bid 1S.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------

With a total of only 21.0-28.0 pts in the partnership, and no agreement in suits, we have to pass.
We pass.
