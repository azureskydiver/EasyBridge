West bids over East's weak 2 bid of 2H ???
>>>>>> WEST <<<<<<<<<
S:J8  H:QJ7  D:AQ874  C:932
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 10.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-0.5;
Total pts = 9.5.
  QT's = 1.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Likely Winners (0/1/4/0)
  8 Likely Losers (2/2/1/3)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
Opening bid for team.
Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 2H.
--------------------
South bids 2S.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Hearts.
REVAL38: (with 3-card Heart trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Spades, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 9.5 to 11.5 points)
RWKT: Partner made a weak 2-bid, showing a a 6+ card suit with 5.0-10.0 points, less than 4 cards in the other major, no voids, and no more than one singleton.
RWKT40: We have 10.0/9.5/11.5 points, for a partnership total of 16.5-21.5 points, so we may be interested in a possible slam.  <<<<<<<<< SLAM ?????????
RWKT48: We don't have very good support for partner's Heart suit (holding QJ7, and don't have the proper distribution for a NT response, so jump shift to 4 Diamonds.  Slam possibilities may be explored later.
We bid 4D.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 4H.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 2 Hearts, 4 Diamonds, and 4 Hearts.
B4C4: Partner made a minimum rebid of his Heart suit at 4 Hearts, showing 10.0-16.0 points and 5+ trump cards.
B4C11: Pass since partner has bid game.
We pass.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 4 Hearts.  Declarer is East; South leads.
