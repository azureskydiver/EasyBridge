We have 8 sure tricks against a requirement of 7 for the 1S contract.
The Heart suit looks the most promising for further development.
Checking play sequencing...
We can fulfill the contract by pulling 2 round(s) of trumps, and cashing the CA, CK, DK, DJ, HA and HK.
Interleaving plays...
The tentative list of available plays is as follows:
------>
 Play 1: Pull a round of trumps with the Ace in dummy.
 Play 2: Pull a round of trumps with the Jack in dummy.
 Play 3: Pull a round of trumps with the six in dummy if necessary.
 Play 4: Pull a round of trumps with the five in dummy if necessary.
