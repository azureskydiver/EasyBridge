OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL6a: But we don't have a suit strong enough to overcall with at the 2-level.
TKOUT: With 20.0/21.0 points and support for all unbid suits, bid a takeout double.
We bid Dbl.
--------------------
North bids 3H.

--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of Double and partner's response of 3 Spades.
TKORb42: Partner has made a jump response of 3 Spades, indicating 10-12 pts and a 4-5 card suit.
TKRb49: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 31.0-33.0 pts.
TKRb72: With a total of 31.0-33.0 points in the partnership, we have insufficient strength to raise partner's 3 Spades bid, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 3 Spades.  Declarer is East; South leads.
