Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Spade.
Adjusting by 1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Spade trump support including a trump honor & a singleton in Clubs, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 1.5 to 5.0 points)
Partner is showing 12.0-18.5 points and 2+ QT's.
But we have only 3.0/1.5/5.0 points, so we have to pass.

3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
Without a compelling suit of our own, we prefer to support partner's first suit of Spades.

We pass.
