Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 13.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 13.0.
  QT's = 2.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  6 Likely Winners (1/1/4/0)
  7 Likely Losers (2/2/1/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
North bids 1C.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVERCL8: Have a good 5-card Diamond suit with 13.0/13.0 points and 6 playing tricks, so overcall the opponents' 1 Club with a bid of 1 Diamond.
We bid 1D.
--------------------
South bids 4NT.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North bids 5H.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Diamond and partner's pass.
We pass.
--------------------
South bids 5NT.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North bids 6C.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.
--------------------
South bids 6H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
TSTDBL4: But upon reconsideration, we have at least 3 likely tricks in the hand, so we can double for penalties.
We bid Dbl.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 6 Hearts (doubled).  Declarer is North; East leads.
=======================
PL02: Starting play as left-hand defender.
PLYLEAD: Making opening lead as East against a contract of 6 Hearts.
PLYLDS3: We can defeat the contract by playing two Aces, so lead them starting with the shortest suit -- lead the DA first.
RCP25: Dummy is shown to be void in Spades.
PLYLDS6c: Try to defeat the contract now by playing the HK.  <<<<<<<<<< NO DUMMY/LHO HAS HA
