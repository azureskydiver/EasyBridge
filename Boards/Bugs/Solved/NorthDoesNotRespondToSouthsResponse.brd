TKOUT: With 13.0/12.0 points and support for all unbid suits, bid a takeout double.
We bid Dbl.
--------------------
East passes.

--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of Double and partner's response of 3 Hearts.
TKORb43: Partner has made a minimum response of 3 Hearts, indicating no more than 9 points. <<<<<<<???
TKRb49: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 12.0-21.0 pts.
TKRb72: With a total of 12.0-21.0 points in the partnership, we have insufficient strength to raise partner's 3 Hearts bid, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Hearts.  Declarer is South; West leads.
