====================
South bids 1D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Diamond.
(with 4-card Diamond trump support including a trump honor, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 14.0 to 16.0 points)
Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
Have 14.0/14.0/16.0 points and good support for partner's minor Diamond suit (holding QT76).  Although we'd prefer not to raise a minor, we have no other good options, so raise to 2 Diamonds.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<NO!!!
We bid 2D.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 5D.

Pass since partner has bid game.
We pass.
