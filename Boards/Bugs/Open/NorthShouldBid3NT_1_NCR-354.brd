S:AJ6  H:A765  D:JT86  C:JT
Hand evaluation:

Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
Opening bid for team.
Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1NT.
--------------------
West bids 3C.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 No Trump.
A10: Partner's bid indicates 15-17 points with balanced hand.
E16: Have 11.0/11.0 points with a openable Heart suit (holding A765), so bid 2 Hearts.
E20: Have 11.0/11.0 points with a 4-card Heart suit (holding A765), so bid 2 Hearts.
But our bid (2 Hearts) is too low vs. the last bid of of 3 Clubs, so we have to pass.   <<<<<<<<<<<<<< 3NT <<<<<<<<<<<<<<??????????
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Clubs.  Declarer is West; North leads.
