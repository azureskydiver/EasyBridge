====================
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1D.
--------------------
West bids 2C.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Diamond.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Diamond trump support & a doubleton in Hearts, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 7.0 to 8.0 points)
F00: Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
F04: But we have only 7.0/7.0/8.0 points against a minor suit bid, so we prefer to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Diamond, Pass, and 2 Spades.
B4P0RV: Partner reversed and bid a higher-ranking suit at the 2-level (2 Spades over 1 Diamond) after our jump response, showing 17.0-18.0 points. ????
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Spade trump support & a doubleton in Hearts, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 7.0 to 8.0 points)
PKF5: Without a compelling suit of our own, we prefer to support partner's second suit of Spades.
BN1: With 24.0+ HCPs in the partnership and a reasonably balanced hand, and all unbid suits stopped, bid 3 No Trump.  <<<<<<<<<<<<?????
We bid 3NT.
