====================
North bids 3H.
--------------------
East doubles.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
TKOTR: Partner has doubled for takeout.
TKORT8: Partner's takeout indicates 12.0+ HCPs, for a total in the partnership of 21.0-30.0 points.
TKOTR33: With 9.0 HCPs and a balanced hand, respond with a bid of 2 No Trump.
But our bid (2 No Trump) is too low vs. the last bid of of 3 Hearts, so we have to pass. <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<NOTE!!!!
We pass.
--------------------
North passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 3 Hearts (doubled).  Declarer is North; East leads.
