Playing card from dummy.
Combined hand (Dummy/Hand):
  S:AQJT87432 (JT7/AQ8432)
  H:AKQJ8754 (AKJ54/Q87)
  D:KJT98763 (KT763/J98)
  C:J (/J)
Combined hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 22.0, Distn pts = 6.0;
  Total pts = 28.0.
  QT's = 4.0,
  Stoppers in: S, H, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Sure Winners (1/4/0/0)
  11 Eventual Winners (5/5/1/0)
  2 Possible Losers (vs. 3 allowable)
Dummy's hand has been laid down; now planning the play with a contract of 4 Spades.
---------------------------
Planning the play...
Combined hand (Dummy/Hand):
  S:AQJT87432 (JT7/AQ8432)
  H:AKQJ8754 (AKJ54/Q87)
  D:KJT98763 (KT763/J98)
  C:J (/J)
Combined hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 22.0, Distn pts = 6.0;
  Total pts = 28.0.
  QT's = 4.0,
  Stoppers in: S, H, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Sure Winners (1/4/0/0)
  11 Eventual Winners (5/5/1/0)
  2 Possible Losers (vs. 3 allowable)
We have 11 sure tricks against a requirement of 10 for the 4S contract.
Looking at the hand for drop plays...
No drop plays are available.
Looking for possible finesses...
Can finesse the King of Diamonds by leading to it from hand against East.
Can finesse the Jack of Diamonds by leading to it from dummy against East.
A total of 2 possible finesses exist.
Looking for ways to force out enemy top cards and promote our own......
We can play the Jack of Diamonds to force out the opponents' Ace.
We can play the Jack of Diamonds to force out the opponents' Queen.
We can play the Jack of Diamonds to force out the opponents' five.
We can play the Jack of Diamonds to force out the opponents' four.
This will promote the eight to a winner.
A total of 4 forcing plays have been found, which will promote 1 lower card.
Looking for ruffing tricks...
We can potentially ruff up to 1 Club in dummy.
We can potentially ruff up to 2 Diamonds in hand after discarding the 2 losers from hand.
Up to 3 ruffs can be used (1 in dummy/2 in hand) out of a total of 5 available, but require 2 discard(s) first.
This consists of the { D8 D9 } from hand.
Looking at the hand for cashes...
We can cash 1 card in Diamonds, plus 5 in Hearts, plus 5 in Spades.
A total of 11 maximum cashing tricks are immediately available.
Evaluating the trumps situation...
We can safely play up to 6 rounds of trumps without endangering the contract.
However, we only need to pull a maximum of 4 rounds to collect all the outstanding trumps.
This will result in (up to) 4 rounds of trumps, 6 cashing tricks in the side suits, and up to 3 ruffing tricks.
Can finesse the Queen of Spades in hand with the Ace as the potential cover card.
Can finesse the Jack of Spades by leading it from dummy, with the Ace as the potential cover card in hand.
Can finesse the Ten of Spades by leading to it from hand against East.
Can finesse the Jack of Spades by leading to it from hand against East.
Removed plan <Trump ten Finesse>, only types 1 & 2 for trump.
Removed plan <Trump Jack Finesse>, only types 1 & 2 for trump.
Reviewing available plays...
Checking logic of selected plays against play history...
Done examining plays...
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
We have 26 possible plays and up to 13 possible tricks including 11 sure tricks (vs. 10 required) accounted for in the plan.
The Diamond suit looks the most promising for further development.
Checking play sequencing...
We want to eventualy exit with a Club.
Interleaving plays...
Postpone the [HJ Cash] so the suit winners in hand are cashed first, to avoid possible stranding.
Postpone the [SA Cash] so the suit winners in dummy are cashed first, to avoid possible stranding.
Postpone the [SQ Cash] so the suit winners in dummy are cashed first, to avoid possible stranding.
The tentative list of available plays is as follows:
------>
 Play 1: Cash the Eight of Hearts in hand.
 Play 2: Cash the Queen of Hearts in hand.
 Play 3: Cash the Jack of Hearts in dummy.
 Play 4: Cash the King of Hearts in dummy.
 Play 5: Cash the Ace of Hearts in dummy.
 Play 6: Exit with a Club and throw the opponents into the lead.
 Play 7: Lead a low trump from dummy to finesse the Queen in hand against East, with the Ace as cover.
 Play 8: Lead the trump Jack from dummy and finesse it, with the Ace in hand as cover.
 Play 9: Pull a round of trumps with the Ace in hand.
 Play 10: Pull a round of trumps with the Queen in hand.
 Play 11: Pull a round of trumps with the Jack in dummy if necessary.
 Play 12: Pull a round of trumps with the ten in dummy if necessary.
 Play 13: Ruff a Club in dummy.
 Play 14: Ruff a Diamond in hand.
 Play 15: Ruff a Diamond in hand.
 Play 16: Lead a low Diamond from hand and finesse the King in dummy against West.
 Play 17: Lead a low Diamond from dummy and finesse the Jack in hand against East.
 Play 18: Play the Jack of Diamonds from hand to force out the opponents' Ace.
 Play 19: Play the Jack of Diamonds from hand to force out the opponents' Queen.
 Play 20: Play the Jack of Diamonds from hand to force out the opponents' Five.
 Play 21: Play the Jack of Diamonds from hand to force out the opponents' Four.
 Play 22: Cash the King of Diamonds in dummy.
 Play 23: Cash the Jack of Spades in dummy.
 Play 24: Cash the Ten of Spades in dummy.
 Play 25: Cash the Queen of Spades in hand.
 Play 26: Cash the Ace of Spades in hand.
 Play 27: Cash the Eight of Spades in hand.
The planning is complete.
---------------------------
The play <H8 Cash> is not yet viable as the card [nine] is still outstanding.
Discard a Heart from dummy in anticipation of cashing the Queen in hand.  <<<<<<<<<<< NO win in dummy to finesse next time
