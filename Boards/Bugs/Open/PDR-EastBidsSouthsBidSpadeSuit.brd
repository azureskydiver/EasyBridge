East bids spades after South overcalled his diamond bid with spades.... seem very foolish.........
East analysis............
S:KJ87  H:KJ  D:AJ932  C:Q6
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 15.0, Distn pts = 2.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.0;
Total pts = 14.0.
  QT's = 2.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  6 Likely Winners (2/1/3/0)
  7 Likely Losers (2/1/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suits are  Diamonds, Spades
The best suit is Diamonds.
====================
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Have 15.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Diamond.
We bid 1D.
--------------------
South bids 1S.
--------------------
West bids 1NT.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Diamond and partner's response of 1 No Trump.
With a 1NT response, partner is showing 5.5-9.5 points, a lack of good support for our Diamond suit, and no other suit available to bid at an appropriate level.
Since partner doesn't like our Diamonds, try 2 Spades.
We bid 2S.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 Spades.  Declarer is East; South leads.
