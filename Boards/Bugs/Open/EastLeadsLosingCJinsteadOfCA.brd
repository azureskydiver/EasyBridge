Playing five-card majors, Hearts can be opened.
Preferred suits are  Diamonds, Hearts
The best suit is Diamonds.
====================
Opening bid for team.
E03: Have 12.0 points in high cards, 2.5 quick tricks, and a rebiddable suit in Hearts, so bid 1 Heart.
We bid 1H.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 1S.
--------------------
South doubles.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Heart and partner's response of 1 Spade.
B3U00: Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid, Spades over Hearts, which shows 5.5-17.5 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
B3U18: With poor support for partner's Spade suit (holding J), and a second openable suit in Diamonds (holding AK852), show it in a 2 Diamonds bid.
We bid 2D.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 3D.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
RDR0: With a single raise, partner is showing 6.0-17.5 points and decent (3-4 card) support for our Diamond suit.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
3REVAL8: Since the trump suit is only topped by a Jack, deduct 0 points.
RDR2: We have a total of 17.5-29.0 points in the partnership, which is not enough for game, so settle for a part score and pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Diamonds.  Declarer is West; North leads.
