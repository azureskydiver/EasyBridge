REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Diamond trump support including a trump honor, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 12.0 to 13.0 points)
RevV0: We'd like to bid the Heart suit, but we can't reverse with less than 17 points.
RevV2: And since the 3rd best suit (Spades) is not strong enough to bid, we have to rebid the original Club suit.
