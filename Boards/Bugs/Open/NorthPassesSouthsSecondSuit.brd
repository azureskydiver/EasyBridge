====================
South bids 1H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Heart.
REVAL38: (with 3-card Heart trump support & a doubleton in Diamonds, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 4.0 to 6.0 points)
F00: Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
G3: Have 5.0/4.0/6.0 points with weak (T32) support for partner's Heart suit but hold a openable 5-card Spade suit, so bid 1 Spade instead.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Heart, 1 Spade, and 2 Diamonds.
B4P04: Partner bid another suit (third suit in partnership) at 2 Diamonds after our 1/1 response, showing 12.0-18.0 points.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
PKF4: Without a compelling suit of our own, we prefer to support partner's first suit of Hearts.
B4P10: With only 5.0/4.0 points in hand, for a total in the partnership of 16.0-22.0 points, we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 2 Diamonds.  Declarer is South; West leads.
