Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
North passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
E04: Have 11.0 points in high cards, 2.0 quick tricks, and a 5-card suit, so bid 1 Heart.
We bid 1H.
--------------------
South bids 2D.
--------------------
West bids 3C.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Heart and partner's response of 3 Clubs.
B3W00: Partner has made a 2 over 1 bid, Clubs over Hearts, which shows 9.0-17.0 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
RevV0: We'd like to bid the Spade suit, but we can't reverse with less than 17 points.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< only 3 card suit????
RevV2: And since the 3rd best suit (Clubs) is not strong enough to bid, we have to rebid the original Heart suit.
B3W41: With poor support for partner'sminor Club suit (holding KQ), and no other good suits, we're forced to rebid our Hearts suit at 3 Hearts.
We bid 3H.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<NO PASS!!!!!!!!!
