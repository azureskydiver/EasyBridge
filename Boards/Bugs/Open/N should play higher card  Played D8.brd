N should have played higherr D - played the D8 and if he would have played the D10 he could have forced at least the DJ. By playing D5, East took trick with D8.

Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 6.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-2.0;
Total pts = 4.0.
  QT's = 0.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  4 Likely Winners (0/2/2/0)
  9 Likely Losers (2/3/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, Hearts can be opened.
Preferred suits are  Diamonds, Hearts
The best suit is Hearts.
====================
Opening bid for team.
Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 1C.
--------------------
South bids 1S.
--------------------
West bids 2H.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Spade.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Spade suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
The total point count in the partnership is therefore 11.5-18.5 points.
This is not enough to bid any higher, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 2NT.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 3C.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.

Bidding finished; contract is 3 Clubs.  Declarer is East; South leads.
=======================
Starting play as right-hand defender.
We do not have a winner in the Spade suit, so discard low with the nine.
Partner's Ace can win the trick, so discard the S9.
Play our only card in the suit, the five.
Dummy is now out of Diamonds.
Play high to win with the five.
