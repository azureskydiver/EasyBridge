North should bid game with 17 HCPs
>>>>>>>>> NORTH<<<<<<<<<
S:75  H:AK5  D:AKT87  C:K63
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 17.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 17.0.
  QT's = 4.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  4 Likely Winners (0/1/3/0)
  9 Likely Losers (2/2/2/3)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
South bids 3C.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 3 Clubs.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Club trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Spades, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 17.0 to 18.0 points)
SHUTR0: Partner made a preemptive 3 Clubs bid, showing a 7-card Club suit with no tricks outside the suit, and most likely 5.0-8.0 points.
SHUTR9: With 17.0/17.0/18.0 points in hand, for a total of 23.0-26.0 points in the partnership, holding K63 in support of partner's Club suit, and with only 4.5 QTs and 4 likely winners, we have no real reason to bid anything, so just pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Clubs.  Declarer is South; West leads.
=======================
RCP5A: South is now known to have started with 0 Diamonds.
RCP5A: East is now known to have started with 1 Club.
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Diamonds.
PLAYCL: South has claimed the remaining 3 tricks.
RESULT: North/South made 2 overtricks.
