West bids 1D.
--------------------
North bids 1H.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Diamond.
REVAL38: (with 4-card Diamond trump support including a trump honor, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 10.0 to 13.0 points)
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Diamond suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 20.5-27.5 points.
YN1: With 20.5-27.5 points in the partnership and 4-card support for partner's  Diamond suit (holding QJ93), raise to 2 Diamonds.
We bid 2D.

B4C19: with zero trump support, we have to escape from partner's Diamonds and bid 3 No Trump.
We bid 3NT.
--------------------
South doubles.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 4.
BXPNTp: Partner has passed, so we pass also.
