====================
South passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
A00: Have 14.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
A02: But with an openable 5-card Heart suit, prefer to open in the major instead of in No Trump.
E01: Have 14.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Heart.
We bid 1H.
--------------------
North bids 2S.
--------------------
East bids 3C.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Heart and partner's response of 3 Clubs.
B3W00: Partner has made a 2 over 1 bid, Clubs over Hearts, which shows 9.0-17.0 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
B3W14: With a balanced distribution, approx. 23.0-31.0 HCPs in the partnership, and  a balanced distribution, bid 2 No Trump in preference to partner's minor.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< 2NT ??? vs
But our bid (2 No Trump) is too low vs. the last bid of of 3 Clubs, so we have to pass.
We pass.

Bidding finished; contract is 3 Clubs.  Declarer is East; South leads.
