Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
A00: Have 19.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
A10: This exceeds the max pts for a 1NT opening (17), but is less than min pts for 2NT (20).  So bid the lowest openable suit of 1 Heart for now, then try for a jump shift to 2NT later. <<<<????
We bid 1H.  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> vs 1NT
--------------------
East passes.

South bids 3H.

Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Heart and partner's response of 3 Hearts.
S00: With a double raise and playing limit raises, partner is showing 10.0-12.0 points and 4+ card support for our Heart suit.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 5.
2REVAL18: Declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract in Hearts from 19.0 down to 18.0 points)
S10: We have 28.0-30.0 total points in the partnership, so bid game at 4 Hearts.
