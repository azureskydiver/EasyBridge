Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Heart.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
F00: Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
G64: We have 9.0/8.0/8.0 points with poor support for partner's Heart suit (holding 2) and not enough strength for a 2/1 response to show our Diamond suit, so bid 1NT.
We bid 1NT.
