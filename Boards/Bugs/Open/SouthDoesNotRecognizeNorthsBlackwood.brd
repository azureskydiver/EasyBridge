Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Heart and partner's response of 1 No Trump.
B3J00: With a 1NT response, partner is showing 5.0-9.0 points, a lack of good support for our Heart suit, and no other suit available to bid at an appropriate level.
B3K30: With 20.0/20.0/25.0 points, jump shift to 3 Diamonds (forcing to game).

BXPNT5: With a total of 25.0-29.0 / 32.0-42.0 pts in the partnership, we lack adequate strength for a further raise beyond partner's 4 No Trump bid, so we have to pass.  <<<<<<<<< NO

BLKWD: with 8.0/8.0/12.0 points in the hand, for a total of approx. 27.0-30.0 / 31.0-34.0 pts in the partnership, explore slam possibilities with Blackwood at 4 No Trump.   <<<<<<<<<  NOTE
