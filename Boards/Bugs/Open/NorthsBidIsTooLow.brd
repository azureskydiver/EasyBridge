====================
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 3S.
--------------------
South doubles.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening double.
TKOTR: Partner has doubled for takeout.
TKORT8: Partner's takeout indicates 12.0+ HCPs, for a total in the partnership of 21.0-30.0 points.
TKOTR33: With 9.0 HCPs and a balanced hand, respond with a bid of 2 No Trump.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<NO should be 3NT
But our bid (2 No Trump) is too low vs. the last bid of of 3 Spades, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Spades (doubled).  Declarer is East; South leads.
