Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Club and partner's response of 2 Diamonds.
B3W00: Partner has made a 2 over 1 bid, Diamonds over Clubs, which shows 9.0-17.0 points and is forcing for one round.
B3W41: With moderate support for partner's minor Diamond suit (holding K96), and no other good suits, we're forced to rebid our Clubs suit at 3 Clubs. <<<< ????
