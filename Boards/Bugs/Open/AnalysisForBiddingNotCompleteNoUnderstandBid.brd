Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 No Trump.
Partner made a strong 2-bid, showing a very good suit or two solid suits, 9+ playing tricks, and 4+ quick tricks.  We have to respond positively if interested in slam, or negatively otherwise.
We have 1.5 QT's, so we can make a positive response.
But we lack good support for partner's No Trump suit (holding ), so show our preferred 6-card Heart suit in a bid of 3 Hearts.
We bid 3H.
--------------------
East passes.

South bids 4H.

REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
3REVAL5: Adding 1 point(s) for the 1 extra trump(s).
3REVAL8: Since the trump suit is only topped by a Ace, deduct 0 points.
Partner has raised to game, showing at least 16.0 points.
With a total of 25.0-31.0 points in the partnership, sign off at partner's game bid and pass.
We pass.
