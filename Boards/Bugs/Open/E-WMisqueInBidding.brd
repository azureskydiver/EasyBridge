====================
South bids 1C.
--------------------
West bids 1D.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Diamond.
REVAL38: (with 3-card Diamond trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Spades, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 12.0 to 14.0 points)
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Diamond suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 21.0-28.0 points.
YN1: With 21.0-28.0 points in the partnership and 3-card support for partner's  Diamond suit (holding AJ8), raise to 3 Diamonds.
--------------------
South doubles.
--------------------
West redoubles.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 3 Diamonds and partner's response of Redouble.
B3Y00: Partner has made a jump shift to Redouble after our opening 3 Diamonds bid, which indicates 18.0+ points and is forcing to game (and points to a possible slam).
B3Y42: With a total of 32.0-35.0 pts in the partnership but poor support for partner's suits, bid our next best suit of Hearts at 3 Hearts.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 4D.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
CUET10: With 32.0+ pts and possible slam aspirations, make a cue bid, showing the cheapest ace (Hearts) with a bid of 4 Hearts.
--------------------
South doubles.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 4.
HRCB40: Partner responded with a cue bid of Pass, showing an Ace in ????. <<<<<<<<<<<???????
HRCB43: But even with partner's ????, it's not clear we have all four Aces for full first-round control.
HRCB46: With only 32.0-35.0 points in the partnershipand without clear first round controls, we can't afford to bid slam, so settle for a contract of 1 Diamond.
But our bid is too low vs. the last bid of of 4 Hearts, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 4 Hearts (doubled).  Declarer is East; South leads.
