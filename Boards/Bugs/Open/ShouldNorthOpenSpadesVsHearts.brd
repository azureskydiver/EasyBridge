>>>>>>>>>>>> NORTH<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
S:AK753  H:AKQ74  D:AQ97  C:943
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 16.0, Distn pts = 3.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 16.0.
  QT's = 4.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H
  Probable Stoppers in:
  7 Likely Winners (3/5/0/-1)
  6 Likely Losers (2/0/0/4)
Playing five-card majors, both majors qualify for opening.
Have a strong suit in Hearts.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
E01: Have 16.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Heart.   <<<<<<<<<<<<< VS 1S then later bid Hearts ???????????????
We bid 1H.
--------------------
East bids 3D.
--------------------
South bids 3H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Heart and partner's response of 3 Hearts.
RDR0: With a single raise, partner is showing 9.0-12.0 points and decent (3-4 card) support for our Heart suit.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
2REVAL16: (after re-evaluation for distribution, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 16.0 to 19.0 points)
R22: We have a total of 28.0-31.0 points in the partnership, which should be enough for game, so bid 4 Hearts.
We bid 4H.
