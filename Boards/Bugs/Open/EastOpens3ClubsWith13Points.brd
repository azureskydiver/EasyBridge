S:K95  H:3  D:75  C:AKJ6543
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 11.0, Distn pts = 3.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 14.0.
  QT's = 2.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  7 Likely Winners (1/0/0/6)
  6 Likely Losers (2/1/2/1)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Have a powerful suit in Clubs.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
Opening bid for team.
D04: Have a 7-card Club suit with no tricks outside the suit, so make a shutout bid of 3 Clubs.
We bid 3C.

West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 3 Clubs and partner's pass.
B3A20: Partner passed, showing < 6 points, so with 11.0/14.0 points in hand and 14.0-19.0 total partnership points, we have no choice but to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Hearts.  Declarer is South; West leads.
=======================
PL03: Starting play as right-hand defender.
PLDF37: Partner's nine might not win the round, so top it with the Jack.

PLCSW9: With no other good options, cash a winner in the Club suit, the Ace
RCP5A: West is now known to have started with 1 Club.
PLYLD44: With no other obvious plays, lead a low trump H3.

PLDF25: Play our only card in the suit, the five.
