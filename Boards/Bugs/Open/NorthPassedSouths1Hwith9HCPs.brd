  8 Likely Losers (1/3/3/1)
Playing five-card majors, Spades can be opened.
Have a strong suit in Spades.
Preferred suit is Spades.
====================
East bids 1D.
--------------------
South bids 1H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Heart.
REVAL38: (with 3-card Heart trump support including a trump honor & a singleton in Clubs, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 7.5 to 11.0 points)
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Heart suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 18.5-25.5 points.
ROVRC20: This is insufficient to raise partner, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 1 Heart.  Declarer is South; West leads.
