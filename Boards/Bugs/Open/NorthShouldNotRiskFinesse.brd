PLN10: We have only 10 sure tricks against a requirement of 11 for the 5D contract.
PLNDRP1: Looking at the hand for drop plays...
PLNDRP5: No drop plays are available.
PLNFNS0: Looking for possible finesses...
PSFNS11: Can finesse the Jack of Clubs in hand with the King as the potential cover card.
PSFNS30: Can finesse the Queen of Spades by leading it from dummy against West.
PSFNS31: Can finesse the Jack of Spades by leading to it from dummy against East.
PSFNS10: Can finesse the Jack of Hearts in dummy with the Ace as the potential cover card.
PSFNS44: Can opportunistically finesse the Jack of Hearts in dummy against West.
PLNFNS90: A total of 5 possible finesses exist.

PLNRF0: Looking for ruffing tricks...
PLNRF1: We can potentially ruff up to 1 Club in dummy.
PLNRF1: We can potentially ruff up to 3 Hearts in hand.
PLNRF1: We can potentially ruff up to 1 Spade in hand after discarding the 2 losers from hand.

PLNTRMP: Evaluating the trumps situation...
PLNTRMP5: We can safely play up to 2 rounds of trumps without endangering the contract.
PLNTRMP8: However, this may not pull in all 4 outstanding trump(s).
PLNTRMP9: This will result in (up to) 2 rounds of trumps, 4 cashing tricks in the side suits, and up to 5 ruffing tricks.
PLYSCN: Reviewing available plays...
PLTSTP: Checking logic of selected plays against play history...
PLNF1: Done examining plays...
