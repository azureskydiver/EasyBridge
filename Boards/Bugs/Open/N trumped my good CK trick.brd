N partner trumped my good DK trick...
+======================

S:QJ97  H:Q94  D:T9732  C:8
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 5.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.0;
Total pts = 4.0.
  QT's = 0.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H
  Probable Stoppers in:
  4 Likely Winners (2/1/1/0)
  9 Likely Losers (2/2/4/1)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suits are  Diamonds, Spades
The best suit is Diamonds.
====================
South bids 1NT.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 No Trump.
Partner's bid indicates 15-17 points with balanced hand.
Responding with a reasonably balanced hand and 5.0 HCP's, for a total in partnership of 20.0-22.0 HCPs.
We do not have quite enough for game even if partner has max opening points, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 2D.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 Diamonds.  Declarer is East; South leads.
=======================
Dummy is shown to be void in Diamonds.
Starting play as right-hand defender.
Play our only card in the suit, the eight.
With no cards in Clubs, trump with the D2.
North is now known to have started with 1 Club.
With no good card to lead, lead the SQ since the opponents have not shown out of the Spade suit.
