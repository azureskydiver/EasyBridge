Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 13.0, Distn pts = 3.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-2.5;
Total pts = 11.5.
  QT's = 1.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  6 Likely Winners (1/0/4/1)
  7 Likely Losers (2/1/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
Opening bid for team.
Have 13.0 points in high cards , so bid a Convenient minor 1 Club.
We bid 1C.
--------------------
East passes.

South bids 1H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Club and partner's response of 1 Heart.
Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid, Hearts over Clubs, which shows 5.5-17.5 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
With poor support for partner's Heart suit (holding K), and a second openable suit in Diamonds (holding KJT864), show it in a 2 Diamonds bid.
We bid 2D.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3C.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
Partner has returned to our first suit, raising it to 3 Clubs.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 5.
2REVAL18: Declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 11.5 down to 9.5 points)
With 15.0-27.0 points in the partnership and no aspirations for a higher contract, we sign off on partner's bid of 3 Clubs.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Clubs.  Declarer is North; East leads.
