North could bid 3NT since partner has bid Heats and clubs  Hand makes 6-7 tricks
>>>>>>>> NORTH<<<<<<<<<<
South bids 1H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Diamond and partner's response of 1 Heart.
B3U00: Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid, Hearts over Diamonds, which shows 6.0-18.0 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 6 point(s) for the 3 trump(s) short of 3.
RevV0: We'd like to bid the Spade suit, but we can't reverse with less than 17 points.
RevV2: And since the 3rd best suit (Clubs) is not strong enough to bid, we have to rebid the original Diamond suit.
B3U18a: With poor support for partner's Heart suit (holding void), and no other suit available to bid, rebid the Diamond suit at 2 Diamonds.
We bid 2D.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3C.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
BXM40: With a 7-card Diamond suit, insist on rebidding it at 3 Diamonds.

--------------------
East passes.
