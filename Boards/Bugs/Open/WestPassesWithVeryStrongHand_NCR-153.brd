South bids 2D.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL6a: But we don't have a suit strong enough to overcall with at the 2-level.
TKOUT: With 21.0/22.0 points and support for all unbid suits, bid a takeout double.
We bid Dbl.
--------------------
North passes.

East bids 2H.

South passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of Double and partner's response of 2 Hearts.
TKORb43: Partner has made a minimum response of 2 Hearts, indicating no more than 9 points.
TKRb49: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 26.0-31.0 pts.
TKRb72: With a total of 26.0-31.0 points in the partnership, we have insufficient strength to raise partner's 2 Hearts bid, so we have to pass.
We pass. <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<NO<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

North passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 2 Hearts.  Declarer is East; South leads.
