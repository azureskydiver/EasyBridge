Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.

The best suit is Hearts.
====================
South bids 1C.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
But we lack the strength for a simple overcall.
We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North bids 1S.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 4S.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 4 Spades.  Declarer is North; East leads.
=======================
Starting play as right-hand defender.
We do not have a winner in the Club suit, so discard low with the nine.
Partner's Jack can win the trick, so discard the C9.
We can't beat North's Ace, so discard the S5.
We can't beat North's King, so discard the S6.
East is now known to have started with 2 Spades.
Play the Queen to win the trick.
With no other obvious plays, play HT.
