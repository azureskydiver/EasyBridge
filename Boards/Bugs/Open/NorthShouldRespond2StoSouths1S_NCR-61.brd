North could respond 2S to South's 1S overcall.  How should South show 17 pts?
>>>>>>> NORTH <<<<
S:QT8  H:K832  D:JT7  C:973
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 6.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.0;
Total pts = 5.0.
  QT's = 0.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H
  Probable Stoppers in:
  3 Likely Winners (1/2/0/0)
  10 Likely Losers (2/2/3/3)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
West bids 1C.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL3: But we lack the strength for a simple overcall.
B00: We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Spade.
REVAL38: (with 3-card Spade trump support including a trump honor, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 5.0 to 7.0 points)
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Spade suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 15.0-22.0 points.
ROVRC10: This is not enough to bid any higher, so pass.  <<<<<<<<<<< ??? Could bid 2S
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 1 Spade.  Declarer is South; West leads.
=======================
RCP5A: East is now known to have started with 1 Spade.
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Spades.
RCP5A: West is now known to have started with 2 Hearts.
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Hearts.
RCP5A: South is now known to have started with 3 Hearts.
PLAYCL: South has claimed the remaining 2 tricks.
RESULT: North/South made 3 overtricks.
