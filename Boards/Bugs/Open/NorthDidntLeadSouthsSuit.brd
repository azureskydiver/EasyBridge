West bids 1D.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL3: But we lack the strength with 1.0 pts for a simple overcall.
B00: We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.

TKORT8: Partner's takeout indicates 12.0+ HCPs, for a total in the partnership of 13.0-22.0 points.
TKOTR12: But Right-hand opponent has bid after partner's double, so the takeout is no longer in effect.
TKOTR17: And with only 2.0/1.0 points, we choose to pass.
We pass.
