South bids 6NT without stopper in Spades
>>>>>>>SOUTH<<<<<<<<<<
We bid 1D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North bids 2H.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Diamond and partner's response of 2 Hearts.
B3Y00: Partner has made a jump shift to 2 Hearts after our opening 1 Diamond bid, which indicates 18.0+ points and is forcing to game (and points to a possible slam).
B3Y22: With a rebiddable Diamonds suit and poor support for partner's Hearts (holding A), rebid our suit at 3 Diamonds.
We bid 3D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North bids 3NT.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
BXPNTA: Partner bid Notrump, indicating a dislike for our Diamond suit.
BN1: With 31.0+ HCPs in the partnership and a reasonably balanced hand, though without stoppers in all suits, bid 6 No Trump. <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<???????????
