OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL6a: But we don't have a suit strong enough to overcall with at the 2-level.
TKOUT: With 12.0/11.0 points and support for all unbid suits, bid a takeout double.
We bid Dbl.

Rebidding after opening bid of Double and partner's response of 2 Spades.
TKORb40: Partner has responded in the enemy suit, indicating 13+ pts but no long suits.
TKRb49: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 24.0-33.0 pts.
TKRb51: The right-hand opponent has bid after partner's response, interfering with our communication.
TKRb91: Without clear suit agreement, we bid our 5-card Diamond suit at 5 Diamonds.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<????????????????
We bid 5D.

South doubles.

West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 5 Diamonds and partner's pass.
B3A20: Partner passed, showing < 6 points, so with 12.0/11.0 points in hand and 11.0-16.0 total partnership points, we have no choice but to pass.
We pass.
