Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Club.
F00: Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
F01a: Have 6.0/5.0/5.0 pts with an available 6-card major suit in Spades (QJ7653), so bid 1 Spade over partner's minor suit 1 Club bid.
We bid 1S.

Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Club, 1 Spade, and 3 Diamonds.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 5.
3REVAL8: Since the trump suit is only topped by a Queen, deduct 1 points.
PKF2: With 4 trumps in partner's second suit (Diamonds), we prefer to support that suit.
B4Q02: Partner made a jump shift to 3 Diamonds in response to our 1 Spade bid, showing 19.0-22.0 points.  The bid is forcing to game.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL5: Adding 1 point(s) for the 1 extra trump(s).
2REVAL38: (with 4-card Diamond trump support including a trump honor & a void in Clubs, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 5.0 to 12.0 points)
BLKWD: with 6.0/5.0/12.0 points in the hand, for a total of approx. 25.0-28.0 / 31.0-34.0 pts in the partnership, explore slam possibilities with Blackwood at 4 No Trump.
B4Q40: We pick Diamonds for the ultimate slam contract suit.
