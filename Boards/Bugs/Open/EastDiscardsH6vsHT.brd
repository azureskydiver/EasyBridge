>>>>>>> EAST <<<<<<<<<<
 S:8743  H:T6  D:K96543  C:5
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 3.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.0;
Total pts = 2.0.
  QT's = 0.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  4 Likely Winners (0/0/4/0)
  9 Likely Losers (4/2/2/1)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
North passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
South bids 1C.
--------------------
West bids 1H.
--------------------
North bids 1S.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Heart.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Heart suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 9.0-16.0 points.
ROVRC10: This is not enough to bid any higher, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
South bids 2NT.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North bids 3NT.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 No Trump.  Declarer is South; West leads.
=======================
PL03: Starting play as right-hand defender.
PLDIS12: We do not have a winner in the Heart suit, so discard low with the six.
PLDF36: Partner's four is high or we can't beat the highest card, so discard the H6.  <<<<<
