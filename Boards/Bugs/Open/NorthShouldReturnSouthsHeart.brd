====================
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 1NT.
--------------------
South bids 2H.
--------------------
West bids 2NT.
--------------------
Responding to partner's  bid of 2 Hearts.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
ROVRC5: Partner overcalled at the 2-level, indicating a good 5+ card Heart suit, 9.0-14.0 points, and probably 6+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 15.0-20.0 points.
ROVRC99: We have insufficient strength for either a raise, suit shift, or NT bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 No Trump.  Declarer is East; South leads.
=======================
PL03: Starting play as right-hand defender.
PLDF40: Play high with the Queen.
PLYLDRT2: We'd like to return partner's Hearts suit, but dummy will most likely win.
