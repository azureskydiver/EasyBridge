Opening bid for team.
E02: Have 12.0 points in high cards and 2.5 quick tricks, so bid 1 Club.
We bid 1C.
--------------------
South bids 1H.
--------------------
West bids 2D.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Club and partner's response of 2 Diamonds.
B3W00a: Partner has made a 2 over 1 bid following an earlier pass, Diamonds over Clubs, which shows 9.0-11.0 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Diamond trump support including a trump honor, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 11.5 to 13.0 points)
B3W41: With weak support for partner'sminor Diamond suit (holding J54), and no other good suits, we're forced to rebid our Clubs suit at 3 Clubs.  <<<<<<<<<<NO
We bid 3C.
