N did jump shift to hearts vs support my spade bid.... I could have been pre-empt??? Is this the right thing to do?
===============
Granted, my bid was out of line!!!!!
=========
S:A7632  H:Q7543  D:J7653  C:AK2
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 13.0, Distn pts = 3.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 13.0.
  QT's = 3.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  8 Likely Winners (3/3/0/2)
  5 Likely Losers (2/2/0/1)
Playing five-card majors, both majors qualify for opening.
Preferred suit is Spades.
====================
West bids 3D.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 3 Spades.
(with 5-card Spade trump support including a trump honor & a void in Diamonds, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 13.0 to 22.0 points)
Partner, opening in fourth position, is showing 10.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
Have 13.0/13.0/22.0 points; show strength by jump shifting to 5 Hearts, even though it's not the preferred suit.
We bid 5H.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 5 Hearts.  Declarer is North; East leads.
