West should play higher Spade on partners opening lead.

S:T854  H:QT32  D:AT42  C:7
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 6.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 6.0.
  QT's = 1.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  4 Likely Winners (0/2/2/0)
  9 Likely Losers (4/2/2/1)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
Opening bid for team.
Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North bids 1NT.
--------------------
East bids 2S.
--------------------
South bids 3NT.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Spades.
REVAL38: (with 4-card Spade trump support & a singleton in Clubs, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 6.0 to 10.0 points)
ROVRC5: Partner overcalled at the 2-level, indicating a good 5+ card Spade suit, 9.0-14.0 points, and probably 6+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 19.0-24.0 points.
ROVRC99: We have insufficient strength for either a raise, suit shift, or NT bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 No Trump.  Declarer is North; East leads.
=======================
RCP5A: South is now known to have started with 0 Spades.
RCP25: Dummy is shown to be void in Spades.
PL03: Starting play as right-hand defender.
PLDIS12: We do not have a winner in the Spade suit, so discard low with the four.
PLDF36: Partner's three is high or we can't beat the highest card, so discard the S4.
