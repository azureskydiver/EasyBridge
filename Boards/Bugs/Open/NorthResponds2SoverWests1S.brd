====================
Opening bid for team.
Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1H.
--------------------
West bids 1S.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Heart.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
F01: Partner, opening in third position, is showing 10.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
H04: Have 11.0/11.0/11.0 points  and weak support for partner's Heart suit (holding 762), so show our preferred Spade suit in a 2 Spades bid.  <<<<<<<<<<<< ???????? perhaps 1NT better
We bid 2S.
