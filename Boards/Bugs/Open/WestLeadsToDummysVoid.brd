Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 10.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.0;
Total pts = 9.0.
  QT's = 1.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  4 Likely Winners (0/0/2/2)
  9 Likely Losers (3/3/2/1)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
South passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North bids 1C.
--------------------
East bids 1S.
--------------------
South bids 2H.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Spade.
REVAL38: (with 3-card Spade trump support including a trump honor, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 9.0 to 10.5 points)
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Spade suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 17.5-24.5 points.
ROVRC20: This is insufficient to raise partner, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North bids 3D.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3H.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.

Bidding finished; contract is 3 Hearts.  Declarer is South; West leads.
=======================
PL02: Starting play as left-hand defender.
PLYLEAD: Making opening lead as West against a contract of 3 Hearts.
PLYLD4: Lead the bottom card of partner's Spade suit (the three.
PLAYB48: We can't beat South's King, so discard the H6.
PLAYDF2: Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
PLDF2G2: There's a chance highcard will be picked up next trick, so win now with the Jack.
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Spades.
PLYLDPRF1: Partner likes the Spade suit, but dummy can ruff, so skip this suit for now.
PLCSW9: With no other good options, cash a winner in the Club suit, the Ace
PLYSIG1: Partner discarded low with the three, so consider it a signal that he dislikes the suit.
PLYLDPRF1: Partner likes the Spade suit, but dummy can ruff, so skip this suit for now.
PLYLDC: Lead the singleton S8 in the hopes of setting up a ruff later.
