North rebid a 3 card diamond suit????
>>>NORTH<<<<<<
S:T875  H:AK4  D:A87  C:J87
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 12.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-0.5;
Total pts = 11.5.
  QT's = 3.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  3 Likely Winners (0/2/1/0)
  10 Likely Losers (4/1/2/3)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Spades.
====================
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Have 12.0 points in high cards and 3.0 quick tricks, so bid 1 Diamond.
We bid 1D.
--------------------
East bids 1S.
--------------------
South bids 2H.
--------------------
West bids 2S.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Diamond and partner's response of 2 Hearts.
Partner has made a 2 over 1 bid, Hearts over Diamonds, which shows 9.0-17.0 points and is forcing for one round.
(with 3-card Heart trump support including a trump honor, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 11.5 to 12.5 points)
With moderate support for partner's Heart suit (holding AK4), and no other good suits, we're forced to rebid our Diamonds suit at 3 Diamonds. <<<<<<<<<<????
We bid 3D.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Diamonds.  Declarer is North; East leads.
