East should play high on diamond. Only three diamonds out and East has DAK
>>>>>EAST<<<
PLDM: Playing card from dummy.
PLNADJ: Reviewing play plan for round 7...
PLRV10: We have only 3 reasonably sure tricks left vs. 5 more trick(s) required for the contract.
PLSEQ: Checking play sequencing...
PLSEQ6: We want to work on developing the Club suit first, so move its plays up to the front if possible.
PINTLV: Interleaving plays...
PLFRC14: Lead a low Diamond (three) from dummy to trigger a force play in hand.
PLFRC62: Play the D8 from hand to try and force out the Ten now.
