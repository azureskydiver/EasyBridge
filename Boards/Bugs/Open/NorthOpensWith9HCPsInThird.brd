====================
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
E07: Have 9.0 points in high cards in 3rd position and a decent Club suit, so bid 1 Club. <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<???????????
We bid 1C.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Club and partner's response of 1 Diamond.
B3U00a: Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid after an earlier pass, Diamonds over Clubs, which shows 5.0-11.0 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
RevV0: We'd like to bid the Spade suit, but we can't reverse with less than 17 points.
RevV2: And since the 3rd best suit (Diamonds) is not strong enough to bid, we have to rebid the original Club suit.
B3U30: With a balanced distribution, bid 1 No Trump in preference to partner's minor.
We bid 1NT.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3NT.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
BXPNT5: With a total of 14.0-20.0 / 13.5-19.5 pts in the partnership, we lack adequate strength for a further raise beyond partner's 3 No Trump bid, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 No Trump.  Declarer is North; East leads.
