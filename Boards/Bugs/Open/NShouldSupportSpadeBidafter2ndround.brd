N keeps bidding clubs when he has 4 of my spades that I bid twice
-------------
N analysis
S:T852  H:J  D:A86  C:AT853
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 9.0, Distn pts = 2.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-0.5;
Total pts = 8.5.
  QT's = 2.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  4 Likely Winners (0/0/1/3)
  9 Likely Losers (4/1/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
South bids 1S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Spade.
(with 4-card Spade trump support & a singleton in Hearts, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 8.5 to 12.5 points)
Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
Have 9.0/8.5/12.5 points but insufficient trump support (holding T852) for a double raise, so show our own Club suit by bidding 2 Clubs.
We bid 2C.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Spade, 2 Clubs, and 2 Spades.
Partner made a minimum rebid of his Spade suit at 2 Spades, showing 12.0-16.0 points and 5+ trump cards.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
2REVAL16: (after re-evaluation for distribution, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 8.5 to 10.5 points)
with a total of 24.5-28.5 pts in the partnership, rebid our suit 3 Clubs.
We bid 3C.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
Despite having 5 cards in our preferred Clubs suit and 24.5-28.5 partnership points, we can't push our minor and can't support partner's major, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Spades.  Declarer is South; West leads.
