Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Diamond and partner's response of 2 Clubs.
B3W00a: Partner has made a 2 over 1 bid following an earlier pass, Clubs over Diamonds, which shows 9.0-11.0 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
B3W40: With poor support for partner's minor Club suit (holding T8), and our first suit not rebiddable, we have to shift to another suit at 2 Spades.   <<<<<<<<<<<<<<< NO SOUTH BID SPADES !!!!!!!!
