North should not bid own suit at 3 level with 9 HCPs
>>>>>NORTH<<<<<<<<<<
S:  H:AT43  D:AJT986  C:764
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 9.0, Distn pts = 4.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 10.0.
  QT's = 2.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  6 Likely Winners (0/2/4/0)
  7 Likely Losers (0/2/2/3)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Have a strong suit in Diamonds.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
South bids 2S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Spades.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 6 point(s) for the 3 trump(s) short of 3.
RWKT: Partner made a weak 2-bid, showing a a 6+ card suit with 5.0-10.0 points, less than 4 cards in the other major, no voids, and no more than one singleton.
RWKT4: We only have 9.0/10.0/9.0 points, for a partnership total of 14.0-19.0 points, which is probably not enough for game.
RWKT8: And we don't like partner's Spade suit (holding void), so shift to our preferred Diamond suit in a bid of 3 Diamonds.  <<<<<<<<< WITH 9 HCPs ???
We bid 3D.
