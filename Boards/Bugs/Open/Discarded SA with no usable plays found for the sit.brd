Opening bid for team.

Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Club and partner's response of 1 Diamond.
Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid after an earlier pass, Diamonds over Clubs, which shows 5.5-11.5 points and is forcing for one round.
(with 3-card Diamond trump support including a trump honor, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 12.5 to 14.0 points)
With a balanced distribution, bid 1 No Trump in preference to partner's minor.
We bid 1NT.
