Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 9.0, Distn pts = 3.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;

  Sure Stoppers in: H, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  7 Likely Winners (0/1/0/6)
  6 Likely Losers (2/2/1/1)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.

====================
East bids 1D.
--------------------
South bids 1S.
--------------------
West bids 3D.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Spade.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Spade suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 19.5-26.5 points.
ROVRC20: And although we want to bid our own 7-card Club suit, we can't bid it at the 4 with only 12.0 points, so pass.
We pass.

East bids 4H.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 5D.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.

Bidding finished; contract is 5 Diamonds.  Declarer is East; South leads.
