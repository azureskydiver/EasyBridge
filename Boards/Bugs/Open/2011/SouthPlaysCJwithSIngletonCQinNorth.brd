South played CJ with singleton CQ in North
>>>>>>>>> NORTH<<<<
East leads the C9.
Playing card from dummy.
Combined hand (Dummy/Hand):
  S:KJT86432 (832/KJT64)
  H:AKQT86 (AQ8/KT6)
  D:AQT98753 (Q983/AT75)
  C:AQJ4 (AJ4/Q)
Combined hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 26.0, Distn pts = 2.0;
  Total pts = 28.0.
  QT's = 5.5,
  Stoppers in: S, H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Sure Winners (0/3/1/1)
  7 Eventual Winners (1/3/1/2)
  6 Possible Losers (vs. 3 allowable)
Dummy's hand has been laid down; now planning the play with a contract of 4 Spades.
---------------------------
Planning the play...
Combined hand (Dummy/Hand):
  S:KJT86432 (832/KJT64)
  H:AKQT86 (AQ8/KT6)
  D:AQT98753 (Q983/AT75)
  C:AQJ4 (AJ4/Q)
Combined hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 26.0, Distn pts = 2.0;
  Total pts = 28.0.
  QT's = 5.5,
  Stoppers in: S, H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Sure Winners (0/3/1/1)
  7 Eventual Winners (1/3/1/2)
  6 Possible Losers (vs. 3 allowable)
We have only 7 sure tricks against a requirement of 10 for the 4S contract.
Looking at the hand for drop plays...
No drop plays are available.
Looking for possible finesses...
Can finesse the Queen of Clubs by leading it from hand, with the Ace as the potential cover card in dummy.
Can finesse the Ten of Diamonds in hand with the Ace as the potential cover card.
Can finesse the Queen of Diamonds by leading to it from hand against East.
A total of 3 possible finesses exist.
Looking for ways to force out enemy top cards and promote our own......
We can play the Jack of Clubs to force out the opponents' King.
No suit development plays have been found.
Looking for ruffing tricks...
We can potentially ruff up to 1 Club in hand.
Looking at the hand for cashes...
We can cash 2 cards in Clubs, plus 1 in Diamonds, plus 3 in Hearts, plus 1 in Spades.
A total of 7 maximum cashing tricks are immediately available. 2 require cards to have been played
Evaluating the trumps situation...
We can safely play up to 1 round of trumps without endangering the contract.
However, this may not pull in all 5 outstanding trump(s).
This will result in  1 round of trumps, 6 cashing tricks in the side suits, and up to 1 ruffing trick.
Reviewing available plays...
Checking logic of selected plays against play history...
Done examining plays...
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
We have 13 possible plays and approx. 9+ possible tricks including 7 sure tricks (vs. 10 required) accounted for in the plan.
The Diamond suit looks the most promising for further development.
Checking play sequencing...
We want to work on developing the Diamond suit first, so move its plays up to the front if possible.
Interleaving plays...
The tentative list of available plays is as follows:
------>
 Play 1: Pull a round of trumps with the King in hand.
 Play 2: Lead a low Diamond from dummy to finesse the ten in hand against East, with the Ace as cover.
 Play 3: Lead a low Diamond from hand and finesse the Queen in dummy against West.
 Play 4: Cash the Ace of Diamonds in hand.
 Play 5: Ruff a Club in hand.
 Play 6: Lead the Club Queen from hand and finesse it, with the Ace in dummy as cover.
 Play 7: Play the Jack of Clubs from dummy to force out the opponents' King.
 Play 8: Cash the Ace of Clubs in dummy.
 Play 9: Cash the Queen of Clubs in hand.
 Play 10: Cash the Ace of Hearts in dummy.
 Play 11: Cash the King of Hearts in hand.
 Play 12: Cash the Queen of Hearts in dummy.
 Play 13: Cash the King of Spades in hand.
The planning is complete.
---------------------------
LHO has led the C9, which is the same suit as our CQ finesse card and lower in value, so we can still try the finesse.
Can't use this (Type II) finesse playing from dummy, as the finesse card (CQ) has to be led from hand.
The opponents led a Club, so play the CJ from dummy to try and force out the King now.  <<<<<<<<<<<< NO, North has singleton Queen
South plays the CJ.

West plays the CK.
