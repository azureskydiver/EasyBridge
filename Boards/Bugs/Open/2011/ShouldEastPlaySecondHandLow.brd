Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 5.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-0.5;
Total pts = 4.5.
  QT's = 1.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  -1 Likely Winners (-1/-1/0/1)
  14 Likely Losers (4/4/3/3)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North bids 1H.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL3: But we lack the strength with 4.5 pts for a simple overcall.
B00: We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
South bids 3H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North bids 4H.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 4 Hearts.  Declarer is North; East leads.
=======================
PL02: Starting play as left-hand defender.
PLYLEAD: Making opening lead as East against a contract of 4 Hearts.
PLYLD18a: Lead the HT Top of sequence.
PLYSIG0: Partner discarded high with the four, so consider it a suit preference signal.
PLAYDF2: Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
PLDF2H2: As second hand, play the lowest card we have in the suit, the eight.
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Hearts.
RCP5A: West is now known to have started with 2 Hearts.
PLAYB41: Play the Ace to win the trick.
PLYLDB: With no other clear plays available, lead a card from the unbid Spade suit.
PLYSIG1: Partner discarded low with the two, so consider it a signal that he dislikes the suit.
RCP5A: North is now known to have started with 1 Club.
PLAYB48: We can't beat South's King, so discard the C2.
PLAYB48: We can't beat North's Ace, so discard the D4.
PLAYDF2: Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
PLDF2G2: There's a chance highcard will be picked up next trick, so win now with the Jack.  <<<<<<<<<???????????
