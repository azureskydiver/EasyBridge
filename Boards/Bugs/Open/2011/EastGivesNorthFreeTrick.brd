====================
South bids 1C.
--------------------
West bids 1H.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Heart.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Heart suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 11.5-18.5 points.
ROVRC10: This is not enough to bid any higher, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
South bids 3C.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Clubs.  Declarer is South; West leads.
=======================
