Over West's double, North must bid 2S as a weak takeout (or 2H if we are using Transfers) - especially since he has a singleton diamond.

Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 No Trump.
Partner's bid indicates 12-14 points with balanced hand.
Responding with a reasonably balanced hand and 8.0 HCP's, for a total in partnership of 20.0-22.0 HCPs.  <<<<<<<<<< Show Spades???? or Xfer ???
We do not have quite enough for game even if partner has max opening points, so pass.

Opening bid for team.
Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
But we lack the strength with 11.0 pts for a simple overcall.
With 12.0/11.0 points and support for all unbid suits, bid a takeout double.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<TKO Dbl of NT ????
We bid Dbl.   >>> SEE TakeoutDoublesConvention line 96
