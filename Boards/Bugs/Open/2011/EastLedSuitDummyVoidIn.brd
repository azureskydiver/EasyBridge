====================
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North bids 2H.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL3: But we lack the strength with 11.0 pts for a simple overcall.
B00: We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 Hearts.  Declarer is North; East leads.
=======================
PL02: Starting play as left-hand defender.
PLYLEAD: Making opening lead as East against a contract of 2 Hearts.
PLYLD4A: Lead the fourth card from our best suit (Clubs) -- play the C2.
PLDF38A: Playing third ahead of dummy, we need to beat dummy's nine, so play the ten.
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Clubs.
PLYLDRT1: We'd like to return partner's Clubs suit, but dummy might ruff.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< YES
PLYLDRT8: Return partner's Club suit with the King.
PLYSIG1: Partner discarded low with the six, so consider it a signal that he dislikes the suit.
