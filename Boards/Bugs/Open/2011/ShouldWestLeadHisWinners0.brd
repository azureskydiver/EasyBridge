Rebidding after opening bid of Double and partner's response of 1 No Trump.
TKRb29: Partner's response of 1 No Trump to our takeout double indicates 6.0-9.0 HCPs, for a total of 21.0-24.0 / 20.5-23.5 pts in the partnership.
TKRb51: The right-hand opponent has bid after partner's response, interfering with our communication.
