--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCTK: With 17.0/17.0 points, the hand is too strong for a simple overcall, so start by doubling.
We bid Dbl.
--------------------
North bids 2S.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of Double and partner's pass.
TKRb10: After interference from the left-hand opponent, partner passed our takeout.

We pass.
