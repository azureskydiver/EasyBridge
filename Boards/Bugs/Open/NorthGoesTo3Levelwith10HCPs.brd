North bids 3C over 2D with 10 HCPs ???
>>>>>>>>> NORTH<<<<<<<<<
S:A52  H:Q6  D:98  C:AT6532
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 10.0, Distn pts = 2.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.0;
Total pts = 9.0.
  QT's = 2.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Likely Winners (1/0/0/4)
  8 Likely Losers (2/2/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
South bids 2D.
--------------------
West doubles.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Diamonds.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
RWKT: Partner made a weak 2-bid, showing a a 6+ card suit with 5.5-10.5 points, less than 4 cards in the other major, no voids, and no more than one singleton.
RWKT4: We only have 10.0/9.0/9.0 points, for a partnership total of 14.5-19.5 points, which is probably not enough for game.
RWKT8: And we don't like partner's Diamond suit (holding 98), so shift to our preferred Club suit in a bid of 3 Clubs.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< ????????
We bid 3C.

East passes.
