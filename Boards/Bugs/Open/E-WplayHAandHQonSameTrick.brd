S:Q864  H:A5  D:K73  C:AQ32
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 15.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 15.0.
  QT's = 3.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  7 Likely Winners (2/1/1/3)
  6 Likely Losers (2/1/2/1)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
Opening bid for team.
A00: Have 15.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
A08: This meet the rqmts for the 1NT opening range (15-17), so bid 1NT.
--------------------
North doubles.
--------------------
East bids 3NT.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 No Trump and partner's response of 3 No Trump.
NT10: Partner's raise from our 1 No Trump to 3 No Trump indicates a balanced hand and 9.0-15.0 HCPs, for a total of 24.0+ HCPs in the partnership.
B3N18: With approx. 24.0-30.0 HCPS in the partnership, partner's game bid of 3NT seems appropriate, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North doubles.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.
