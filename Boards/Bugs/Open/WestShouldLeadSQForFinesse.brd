[[File Comments]]
West should lead SQ for a finesse against North
>>>> WEST <<<<<<<<
PLNADJ: Reviewing play plan for round 6...
PLRV10: We have only 6 reasonably sure tricks left vs. 7 more trick(s) required for the contract.
PLSEQ: Checking play sequencing...
PLSEQ6: We want to work on developing the Spade suit first, so move its plays up to the front if possible.
PINTLV: Interleaving plays...
PL1FN12: Leading a low Spade (the three) from hand to finesse the ten in dummy.   <<<<<<<<< NO lead SQ from hand
PLDM: Playing card from dummy.
PLCSH74: Finesse the ST from dummy.
