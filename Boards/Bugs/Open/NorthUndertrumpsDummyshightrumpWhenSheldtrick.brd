Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 9.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.0;

  QT's = 1.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  3 Likely Winners (0/0/0/3)
  10 Likely Losers (2/3/3/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 1H.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
But we lack the strength for a simple overcall.
We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 2H.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 Hearts.  Declarer is West; North leads.
=======================
Starting play as left-hand defender.
Making opening lead as North against a contract of 2 Hearts.
Lead the SJ Top of doubleton.
Partner discarded low with the two, so consider it a signal that he dislikes the suit.
Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
Play second hand low with the four.
Play our only card in the suit, the four.
Dummy is now out of Spades.
Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
West led an honor (the Jack), so cover it with our Queen.
South is now known to have started with 1 Heart.
With no other good options, cash a winner in the Club suit, the Ace
With no good card to lead, lead the D2 since the opponents have not shown out of the Diamond suit.
PLDF55: With no cards in Spades, trump with the H9.
