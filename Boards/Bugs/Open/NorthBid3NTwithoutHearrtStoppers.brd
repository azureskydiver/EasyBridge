====================

Opening bid for team.
E01: Have 14.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Club.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Club and partner's response of 1 Spade.
B3U00: Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid, Spades over Clubs, which shows 5.0-17.0 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
B3U22: With a rebiddable Club suit and insufficient support for partner's Spades (holding 87), rebid at 2 Clubs.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
BXM70: Partner switched suits again, which forces us to bid again -- so with no other good options, bid 3 No Trump.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 No Trump.  Declarer is North; East leads.
