Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Heart.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
F00: Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
I12: Have 10.0/13.0/13.0 points but insufficient trump support (holding 8) for a double raise, so show our own Club suit by bidding 2 Clubs.
We bid 2C.

South passes.
--------------------

REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Diamond trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Spades,  & a singleton in Hearts, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 13.0 to 14.0 points)
PKF2: With 3 trumps in partner's second suit (Diamonds), we prefer to support that suit.
YR2: With With 26.0-32.0 total points and a powerful 7-card Club suit (holding AKT7643), rebid it at 3 Clubs.
We bid 3C.
