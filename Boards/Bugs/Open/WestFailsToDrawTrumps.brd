S:9  H:Q87  D:AK753  C:KQJ4
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 15.0, Distn pts = 2.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 15.0.
  QT's = 3.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  8 Likely Winners (0/1/4/3)

Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suits are  Clubs, Diamonds
The best suit is Diamonds.
====================
Opening bid for team.
E01: Have 15.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Diamond.
We bid 1D.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 1H.
--------------------
South doubles.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Diamond and partner's response of 1 Heart.
B3U00: Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid, Hearts over Diamonds, which shows 5.0-17.0 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Heart trump support including a trump honor & a singleton in Spades, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 15.0 to 18.0 points)
B3U68: With 3-card support for partner's Hearts (holding Q87), 15.0/15.0/18.0 points, an unbalanced hand, and our primary Diamond suit not jump rebiddable, we have to show our strength by shifting to 2 Clubs, regardless of that suit's strength.
We bid 2C.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 2D.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
BXC00: Partner has returned to our first suit, raising it to 2 Diamonds.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
2REVAL16: (after re-evaluation for distribution, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 15.0 to 17.0 points)
BXC06: And with 5 trump cards and 22.0-34.0 team points, push on to a minor game at 5 Diamonds.
We bid 5D.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 5 Diamonds.  Declarer is West; North leads.
