Seems bad that West declarer trumped with the A in dummy vs a smaller card in hand.. Possibly transportation, but analysis doesn't say... The A would be useful for claiming one trump trick... now he will loose 2.

We have only 6 sure tricks against a requirement of 10 for the 4S contract.
The Diamond suit looks the most promising for further development.
Checking play sequencing...
We want to work on developing the Diamond suit first, so move its plays up to the front if possible.
Interleaving plays...
The tentative list of available plays is as follows:
------>
 Play 1: Pull a round of trumps with the Ace in dummy.
 Play 2: Cash the Ace of Diamonds in dummy.
 Play 3: Cash the King of Diamonds in dummy.
 Play 4: Ruff a Diamond in hand.
 Play 5: Ruff a Diamond in hand.
 Play 6: Ruff a Diamond in hand.
 Play 7: Ruff a Diamond in hand.
 Play 8: Ruff a Diamond in hand.
 Play 9: Play the Nine of Diamonds from dummy to force out the opponents' Queen.
 Play 10: Play the Nine of Diamonds from dummy to force out the opponents' Jack.
 Play 11: Play the Nine of Diamonds from dummy to force out the opponents' Seven.
 Play 12: Play the Nine of Diamonds from dummy to force out the opponents' Six.
 Play 13: Cash the Ace of Clubs in hand.
 Play 14: Cash the King of Clubs in dummy.
 Play 15: Cash the Queen of Clubs in hand.
 Play 16: Cash the Ace of Spades in dummy.
The planning is complete.
