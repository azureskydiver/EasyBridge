Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 15.0, Distn pts = 2.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 15.0.
  QT's = 2.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  7 Likely Winners (1/2/1/3)
  6 Likely Losers (1/2/1/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
Opening bid for team.
E01: Have 15.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Club.
We bid 1C.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Club and partner's response of 1 Diamond.
B3U00: Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid, Diamonds over Clubs, which shows 5.0-17.0 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
RevV0: We'd like to bid the Heart suit, but we can't reverse with less than 17 points.
RevV2: And since the 3rd best suit (Diamonds) is not strong enough to bid, we have to rebid the original Club suit.
B3U18a: With poor support for partner's Diamond suit (holding A5), and no other suit available to bid, rebid the Club suit at 2 Clubs.
We bid 2C.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2NT.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
BXPNTA: Partner bid Notrump, indicating a dislike for our Club suit.
BXPNT4: Partner's 2 No Trump bid indicates a preference for NoTrump.
BXPNT5: With a total of 20.0-32.0 / 20.0-32.0 pts in the partnership, we lack adequate strength for a further raise beyond partner's 2 No Trump bid, so we have to pass.
We pass.   <<<<<<<<<<< 3NT ???????????
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 No Trump.  Declarer is South; West leads.
