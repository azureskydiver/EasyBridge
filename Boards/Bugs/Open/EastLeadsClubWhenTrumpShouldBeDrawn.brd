Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Club and partner's response of 1 Heart.
B3U00a: Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid after an earlier pass, Hearts over Clubs, which shows 5.0-11.0 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL38: (with 4-card Heart trump support including a trump honor & doubletons in Diamonds and Spades, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 17.0 to 21.0 points)
B3U72: With 4-card support for partner's Hearts (holding K743) and 17.0/17.0/21.0 points in hand (for 26.0-32.0 points in the partnership), we have enough for game, so bid 4 Hearts.
