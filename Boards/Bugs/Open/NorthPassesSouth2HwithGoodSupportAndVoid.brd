====================
West bids 1S.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVERCL8: Have a good 6-card Club suit with 10.0/10.0 points and 7 playing tricks, so overcall the opponents' 1 Spade with a bid of 2 Clubs.
We bid 2C.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 2 Clubs and partner's response of 2 Hearts.
OVRRB22: Partner bid his own Hearts suit at the 2 level in response to our 2 Clubs overcall, indicating 6+ cards and approx. 10.0-12.0 points.
OVRRB88: As we lack agreement in suits and have only 20.0-22.0 team points, we have no good options other than to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 2 Hearts.  Declarer is South; West leads.
