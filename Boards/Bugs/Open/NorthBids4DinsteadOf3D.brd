Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 No Trump, 2 Spades, and 3 Clubs.
JC32: Partner replied to our Jacoby transfer with 3 Clubs indicating 15-17 points for a total in the partership of 24.0-26.0 points.
JC18: We instructed partner to bid Clubs last time because we're not playing 4-suit transfers, so we now want to correct to Diamonds.
JC60: With 7.0/7.0/9.0 points in the hand, and a total in the partnership of 24.0-26.0 points, bid 4 Diamonds.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<??? why not 3D ????
