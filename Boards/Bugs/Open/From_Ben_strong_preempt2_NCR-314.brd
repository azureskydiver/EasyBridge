[[File Comments]]
Norm,
 
Thanks for the feedback.
 
I wil definitely admit to being more of a beginner/social player and I have never played Duplicate so I don't understand the scoring or strategy of Duplicate.  Maybe I wouldn't have questions if I had that foundation. 
 
That being said up front, under what bidding system can West open with 3H?  I can understand South bidding 4C but I still consider that to be a pretty risky move (at least in Rubber bridge it is).  I just edited the hand to slightly change West (from 2 to 3 HCP and still has 3-4 distribution points...since the Diamond HCP or dist point is now debateable).  I didn't change South at all and only made slight changes to North and East.  The changes didn't affect the bidding at all but did affect the results significantly.
 
Just playing it, I was able to set the 3H-doubled by 3.  When I bid 4C as South, I got set by 1. 
 
Thoughts?
Ben
