With 16.5/16.5 points and support for all unbid suits, bid a takeout double.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------

--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of Double and partner's response of 4 Hearts.
Partner has jumped to game in Hearts, indicating 13+ pts and a 5+ card suit.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< NOT A JUMP, an OVERCALL ???????????/
The total point count in the partnership is therefore 46.5-38.5 pts.
with 17.0/16.5/16.5 points in the hand, for a total of approx. 47.0-39.0 / 46.5-38.5 pts in the partnership, explore slam possibilities with Blackwood at 4 No Trump.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 4 Hearts, 4 No Trump, and 5 Hearts.
Partner responded to our 4NT Blackwood inquiry with 5 Hearts, indicating 2 Aces.
Our team holds all four aces, so proceed to 5NT to ask for kings.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 6C.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 4.
Partner responded to our 4NT Blackwood inquiry with 6 Clubs, indicating 0 King.
Since we're missing 2 Kings and have a total of only 46.5-38.5 pts in the partnership, we lack sufficient strength for a grand slam and have to settle for a small slam at 6 Hearts.
