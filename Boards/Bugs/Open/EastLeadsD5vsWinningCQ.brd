Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 12.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;

  QT's = 2.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, D, C

  5 Likely Winners (0/2/1/2)
  8 Likely Losers (3/1/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
Opening bid for team.
E02: Have 12.0 points in high cards and 2.0 quick tricks, so bid 1 Club.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 1H.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Club and partner's response of 1 Heart.
B3U00: Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid, Hearts over Clubs, which shows 5.0-17.0 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL38: (with 3-card Heart trump support including a trump honor, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 12.0 to 13.0 points)
B3U14: With decent 3-card support for partner's major Heart suit (holding KQ2), no rebiddable suit, and no openable second suit, raise to 2 Hearts.
--------------------
South bids 3C.
--------------------
West bids 3H.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
BXM81: We've reached agreement in suits, but with only 18.0-30.0 total points we can't raise partner's 3 Hearts bid any further, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Hearts.  Declarer is West; North leads.
