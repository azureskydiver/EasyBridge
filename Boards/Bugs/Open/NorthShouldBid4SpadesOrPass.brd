>>>>>>>>> NORTH<<<<<<
S:AT72  H:6  D:T54  C:A9863
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 8.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;

  Sure Stoppers in: S, C

  8 Likely Losers (2/1/3/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suits are  Clubs, Spades
The best suit is Clubs.
====================
West bids 3H.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
B00: We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 3 Spades.
REVAL38: (with 4-card Spade trump support including a trump honor & a singleton in Hearts, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 8.0 to 13.0 points)  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< 13 pts??? vs 11 ?????????/
F01: Partner, opening in fourth position, is showing 10.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
I08: Have 8.0/8.0/13.0 points with 4-card support for partner's Spades (holding AT72), which is too strong for a limit raise, so we have to temporarily shift to Clubs with a bid of 4 Clubs.  <<<<<<<<< NO either bid 4S or pass<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
We bid 4C.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
