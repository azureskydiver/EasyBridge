REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
4REVAL21: Adjusting by 1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Spade trump support including a trump honor, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 12.0 to 13.0 points)
B3W41: With moderate support for partner's Spade suit (holding AQ4), and no other good suits, we're forced to rebid our Diamonds suit at 3 Diamonds. ???????
