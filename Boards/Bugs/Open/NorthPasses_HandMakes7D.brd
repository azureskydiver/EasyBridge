>>>>>>>>>> NORTH <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
S:A  H:T7  D:KQJT4  C:J9853
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 11.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 11.0.
  QT's = 2.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  7 Likely Winners (1/0/4/2)
  6 Likely Losers (0/2/1/3)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
South bids 1S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Spade.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
F00: Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
H04: Have 11.0/11.0/11.0 points  and poor support for partner's Spade suit (holding A), so show our preferred Diamond suit in a 2 Diamonds bid.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Spade, 2 Diamonds, and 3 Diamonds.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
3REVAL8: Since the trump suit is only topped by a Ace, deduct 0 points.
B4H14: Partner made a single raise of our 2 Diamonds bid to 3 Diamonds, showing 12.0 -18.0 points and 3+ trump cards.
B4H35: We have a total of approx. 23.0-29.0 in the partnership, but we do not have a rebiddable suit, nor do we have enough stoppers for a NT contract, so we have to sign off on partner's 3 Diamonds bid.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Diamonds.  Declarer is North; East leads.
