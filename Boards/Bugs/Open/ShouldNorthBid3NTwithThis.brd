>>>>>NORTH<<<<<<<<
S:654  H:KJT9  D:Q96  C:A93
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 10.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 10.0.
  QT's = 1.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  4 Likely Winners (0/2/1/1)
  9 Likely Losers (3/2/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Heart.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL5: Adding 1 point(s) for the 1 extra trump(s).
2REVAL38: (with 4-card Heart trump support including a trump honor, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 10.0 to 12.0 points)
F00: Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
I08: Have 10.0/10.0/12.0 points with 4-card support for partner's Hearts (holding KJT9), which is too strong for a limit raise, so we have to temporarily shift to Clubs with a bid of 2 Clubs.
We bid 2C.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2NT.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Heart, 2 Clubs, and 2 No Trump.
NT43: Partner's shift from our 2 Clubs bid to 2 No Trump indicates a balanced hand and 13.0+ points, for a total of 23.0+ points in the partnership.
B4F14: with 10.0/10.0 points in hand, and a total of 23.0-26.0 in the partnership, sign off on partner's contract of 2NT.
We pass.
--------------------
