F01: Partner, opening in fourth position, is showing 10.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
I08: Have 8.0/7.0/15.0 points with 5-card support for partner's Hearts (holding K8652), which is too strong for a limit raise, so we have to temporarily shift to Spades with a bid of 1 Spade.
We bid 1S.

BLKWD: with 8.0/7.0/15.0 points in the hand, for a total of approx. 25.0-28.0 / 32.0-35.0 pts in the partnership, explore slam possibilities with Blackwood at 4 No Trump.
