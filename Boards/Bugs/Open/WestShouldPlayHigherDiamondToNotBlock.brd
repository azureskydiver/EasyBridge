PLN10: We have 7 sure tricks against a requirement of 7 for the 1NT contract.
PLNPRI: The Club suit looks the most promising for further development.
PLSEQ: Checking play sequencing...
PLSEQ1: Since we have enough cashing tricks (7) to fulfill the contract, we can just proceed with the cashing.
PINTLV: Interleaving plays...
PLN90: The tentative list of available plays is as follows:
------>
 Play 1: Cash the Ace of Clubs in hand.
 Play 2: Cash the King of Clubs in hand.
 Play 3: Cash the Ace of Diamonds in hand.
 Play 4: Cash the King of Diamonds in hand.
 Play 5: Cash the Ten of Diamonds in hand.
 Play 6: Cash the Jack of Diamonds in dummy.
 Play 7: Cash the Queen of Diamonds in dummy.
 Play 8: Lead a low Club from dummy to finesse the ten in hand against North, with the { CA CK  } as possible cover cards.
 Play 9: Lead a low Spade from dummy and finesse the Queen in hand against North.
PLN95: The planning is complete.
---------------------------
PLCSH56: Discard a Diamond from dummy in anticipation of cashing the Ace in hand.
PLCSH80: the opponents led a Diamond, so see if we can finish up the cash play here.
PLCSH85: We can actually play the ten to win this trick, so postpone the cash of the Ace.
PLYTRY: No usable plays found for the current situation.
PLYE41: Play the ten to win the trick.   <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<NO play higher to NOT block Diamonds
