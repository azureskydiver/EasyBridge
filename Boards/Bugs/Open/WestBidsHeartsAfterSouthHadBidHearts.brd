  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D

Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================

--------------------
East bids 1C.
--------------------
South bids 2H.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Club.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Club trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Spades, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 13.0 to 14.0 points)
F00: Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
I14: Have 13.0/13.0/14.0 points but we prefer to shift instead of raising a minor Club suit, so show our own Heart suit by bidding 3 Hearts.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<????
We bid 3H.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
