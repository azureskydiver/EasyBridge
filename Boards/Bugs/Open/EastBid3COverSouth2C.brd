East bid 3C over South's 2C bid after East had originally opened 1NT.
--------------------------------
East analysis==========================????????????????
S:KQ2  H:AQT  D:876  C:KQ92
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 16.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 16.0.
  QT's = 3.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  7 Likely Winners (2/2/0/3)
  6 Likely Losers (1/1/3/1)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
North passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Have 16.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
This meet the rqmts for the 1NT opening range (15-17), so bid 1NT.
We bid 1NT.
--------------------
South bids 2C.
--------------------
West bids 2S.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 No Trump and partner's response of 2 Spades.
Partner has made a 2 over 1 bid, Spades over No Trump, which shows 9.5-17.5 points and is forcing for one round.
(with 3-card Spade trump support including a trump honor, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 16.0 to 17.0 points)
With moderate support for partner's Spade suit (holding KQ2), and our first suit not rebiddable, we have to shift to another suit at 3 Clubs.
We bid 3C. <==============================South had prev. bid 2C ===>>>>????
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Clubs.  Declarer is East; South leads.
