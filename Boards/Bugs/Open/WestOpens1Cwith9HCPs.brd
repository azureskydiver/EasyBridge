West opens 1C with 9 HCPs ????
>>>>> WEST<<<<<<<
S:KQ74  H:983  D:T65  C:A54
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 9.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 9.0.
  QT's = 2.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  4 Likely Winners (3/0/0/1)
  9 Likely Losers (1/3/3/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Spades.
====================
North passes.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
E07: Have 9.0 points in high cards in 4th position and a weak Club suit, so bid 1 Club.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<< ??????????????
We bid 1C.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 1D.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Club and partner's response of 1 Diamond.
B3U00a: Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid after an earlier pass, Diamonds over Clubs, which shows 5.0-11.0 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
RevV0: We'd like to bid the Spade suit, but we can't reverse with less than 17 points.
RevV2: And since the 3rd best suit (Diamonds) is not strong enough to bid, we have to rebid the original Club suit.
B3U30: With a balanced distribution, bid 1 No Trump in preference to partner's minor.
We bid 1NT.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 2NT.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
BXPNT5: With a total of 14.0-20.0 / 14.0-20.0 pts in the partnership, we lack adequate strength for a further raise beyond partner's 2 No Trump bid, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 No Trump.  Declarer is West; North leads.
