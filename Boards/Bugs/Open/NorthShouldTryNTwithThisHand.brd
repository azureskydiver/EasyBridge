Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 16.0, Distn pts = 2.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 16.0.
  QT's = 3.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  7 Likely Winners (0/3/3/1)
  6 Likely Losers (1/1/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suits are  Diamonds, Hearts
The best suit is Diamonds.
====================
Opening bid for team.
E01: Have 16.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Diamond.
We bid 1D.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Diamond and partner's response of 1 Spade.
B3U00: Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid, Spades over Diamonds, which shows 5.0-17.0 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
RevV0: We'd like to bid the Heart suit, but we can't reverse with less than 17 points.
RevV2: And since the 3rd best suit (Clubs) is not strong enough to bid, we have to rebid the original Diamond suit.
B3U18a: With poor support for partner's Spade suit (holding 8), and no other suit available to bid, rebid the Diamond suit at 2 Diamonds.
We bid 2D.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
RDR0: With a single raise, partner is showing 6.0-17.0 points and decent (3-4 card) support for our Diamond suit.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
2REVAL16: (after re-evaluation for distribution, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 16.0 to 18.0 points)
R27: We have a total of 24.0-35.0 points in the partnership, which is not quite enough for game in a minor suit, so pass.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<< NT ??????????
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Diamonds.  Declarer is North; East leads.
