East Played his NT very badly, I think.
==============================================
S:AQ8  H:JT53  D:AJ9  C:K95
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 15.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 15.0.
  QT's = 3.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  3 Likely Winners (1/1/1/0)
  10 Likely Losers (2/3/2/3)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
North passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Have 15.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
This meet the rqmts for the 1NT opening range (15-17), so bid 1NT.
We bid 1NT.
--------------------
South doubles.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 No Trump and partner's pass.
Partner passed, showing < 6 points, so with 15.0/15.0 points in hand and 15.0-20.0 total partnership points, we have no choice but to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 1 No Trump (doubled).  Declarer is East; South leads.

We have only 5 sure tricks against a requirement of 7 for the 1NT X contract.
The Heart suit looks the most promising for further development.
Checking play sequencing...
We want to work on developing the Heart suit first, so move its plays up to the front if possible.
Interleaving plays...
The tentative list of available plays is as follows:
------>
 Play 1: Lead the Heart Jack from hand and finesse it, with the Ace in dummy as cover.
 Play 2: Lead a low Heart from dummy and finesse the ten in hand against South.
 Play 3: Lead a low Heart from dummy and finesse the Jack in hand against South.
 Play 4: Cash the Ace of Hearts in dummy.
 Play 5: Hold up a round of Spades.
 Play 6: Hold up a round of Spades.
 Play 7: Lead a low Spade from dummy to finesse the Queen in hand against South, with the Ace as cover.
 Play 8: Lead a low Diamond from dummy to finesse the Jack in hand against South, with the Ace as cover.
 Play 9: Cash the Ace of Spades in hand.
 Play 10: Cash the Ace of Clubs in dummy.
