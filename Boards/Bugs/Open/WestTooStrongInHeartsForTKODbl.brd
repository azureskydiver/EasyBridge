West was too strong in Hearts for TKO dbl
>>>>>>> WEST<<<<<<<<<<
S:T652  H:AJ6  D:K75  C:KQ4
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 13.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 13.0.
  QT's = 2.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  1 Likely Winners (-1/1/0/1)
  12 Likely Losers (5/2/3/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Spades.
====================
South bids 3H.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL3: But we lack the strength for a simple overcall.
TKOUT: With 13.0/13.0 points and support for all unbid suits, bid a takeout double.  <<<<<<<<<< TOO Strong in Hearts
We bid Dbl.   
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 4D.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of Double and partner's response of 4 Diamonds.
TKORb43: Partner has made a minimum response of 4 Diamonds, indicating no more than 9 points.
TKRb49: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 17.0-22.0 pts.
TKRb72: With a total of 17.0-22.0 points in the partnership, we have insufficient strength to raise partner's 4 Diamonds bid, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 4 Diamonds.  Declarer is East; South leads.
