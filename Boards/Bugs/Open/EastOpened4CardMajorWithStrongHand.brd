East bid a 4 card major
>>>>>>>>>> EAST<<<<<<<
S:A3  H:AQ43  D:K986  C:AJ3
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 18.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 18.0.
  QT's = 4.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  7 Likely Winners (1/3/2/1)
  6 Likely Losers (1/1/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
A00: Have 18.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
A10: This exceeds the max pts for a 1NT opening (17), but is less than min pts for 2NT (20).  So bid the lowest openable suit of 1 Heart for now, then try for a jump shift to 2NT later.   <<<<<<<<<<<<<<< IS THIS OK ???????????
We bid 1H.
--------------------
South bids 2S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Heart and partner's pass.
B3A20: Partner passed, showing < 6 points, so with 18.0/18.0 points in hand and 18.0-23.0 total partnership points, we have no choice but to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 Spades.  Declarer is South; West leads.
