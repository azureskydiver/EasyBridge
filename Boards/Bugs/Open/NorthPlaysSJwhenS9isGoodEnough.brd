West bids 3D.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Hearts.
REVAL38: (with 4-card Heart trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Clubs, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 8.0 to 12.0 points)
ROVRC5: Partner overcalled at the 2-level, indicating a good 5+ card Heart suit, 9.5-14.5 points, and probably 6+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 21.5-26.5 points.
ROVRC99: We have insufficient strength for either a raise, suit shift, or NT bid, so pass.
We pass.

East bids 3S.
--------------------
South bids 4H.
--------------------
West bids 4S.
--------------------
