Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 9.0, Distn pts = 2.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;

  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  6 Likely Winners (4/1/0/1)

Playing five-card majors, Spades can be opened.
Preferred suit is Spades.

Rebidding after opening bid of 2 Spades and partner's response of 2 No Trump.   <<<<<<<<< Asking for 'feature' see below
B3Z00: Partner made a response which we don't understand; simply pass.

Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 10.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-0.5;
Total pts = 9.5.
  QT's = 2.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  3 Likely Winners (2/0/1/0)
  10 Likely Losers (2/2/2/4)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Spades.

South bids 2S.

Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Spades.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL5: Adding 1 point(s) for the 1 extra trump(s).
2REVAL38: (with 4-card Spade trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Hearts, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 9.5 to 12.5 points)
RWKT: Partner made a weak 2-bid, showing a a 6+ card suit with 5.0-10.0 points, less than 4 cards in the other major, no voids, and no more than one singleton.
We have 10.0/9.5/12.5 points, for a partnership total of 17.5-22.5 points, so we are interested in game if a good fit can be found.
RWKT21: And we like partner's Spade suit (holding AJ65 support), but with only 17.5-22.5 total pts we don't quite have enough for a direct game bid, so invite partner to show an outside Ace or King with a bid of 2NT.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<NOTE
We bid 2NT.
