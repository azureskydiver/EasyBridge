Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 16.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 16.0.
  QT's = 3.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  7 Likely Winners (2/1/2/2)
  6 Likely Losers (1/1/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
South bids 1C.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL6a: But we don't have a suit strong enough to overcall with at the 2-level.
A00: Have 16.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
A08: This meet the rqmts for the 1NT opening range (15-17), so bid 1NT.
We bid 1NT.
--------------------
South bids 2C.
--------------------
West bids 3NT.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 No Trump and partner's response of 3 No Trump.
NT10: Partner's raise from our 1 No Trump to 3 No Trump indicates a balanced hand and 11.0-15.0 HCPs, for a total of 27.0+ HCPs in the partnership.
B3N18: With approx. 27.0-31.0 HCPS in the partnership, partner's game bid of 3NT seems appropriate, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 No Trump.  Declarer is East; South leads.
