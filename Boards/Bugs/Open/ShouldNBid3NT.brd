Why didn't N bid NT after I bid Diamonds and Clubs and he had Hearts and Spades stopped...

S:AK5  H:KQJ3  D:A6  C:J982
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 18.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 18.0.
  QT's = 4.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  7 Likely Winners (2/3/1/1)
  6 Likely Losers (1/1/1/3)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Have 18.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
This exceeds the max pts for a 1NT opening (17), but is less than min pts for 2NT (20).  So bid the lowest openable suit of 1 Heart for now, then try for a jump shift to 2NT later.
We bid 1H.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Heart and partner's response of 2 Diamonds.
Partner has made a 2 over 1 bid following an earlier pass, Diamonds over Hearts, which shows 9.5-11.5 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
With poor support for partner'sminor Diamond suit (holding A6), and no other good suits, we're forced to rebid our Hearts suit at 2 Hearts.
We bid 2H.
