====================
West bids 1D.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL3: But we lack the strength for a simple overcall.
B00: We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 1NT.
--------------------
South bids 2S.
--------------------
West bids 3H.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Spades.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL5: Adding 5 point(s) for the 3 extra trump(s).
2REVAL38: (with 6-card Spade trump support including a trump honor & doubletons in Diamonds and Hearts, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 7.0 to 15.0 points)  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<?????????????????
ROVRC5: Partner overcalled at the 2-level, indicating a good 5+ card Spade suit, 9.0-14.0 points, and probably 6+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 24.0-29.0 points.
YN1: With 24.0-29.0 points in the partnership and 6-card support for partner's major Spade suit (holding K98642), raise to 4 Spades.
We bid 4S.
