PLN10: We have only 8 sure tricks against a requirement of 9 for the 3NT contract.
PLNPRI: The Heart suit looks the most promising for further development.
PLSEQ: Checking play sequencing...
PLSEQ6: We want to work on developing the Heart suit first, so move its plays up to the front if possible.
PINTLV: Interleaving plays...
PLN90: The tentative list of available plays is as follows:
------>
 Play 1: Lead a low Heart from dummy and finesse the Jack in hand against North.
 Play 2: Cash the Ace of Hearts in dummy.
 Play 3: Cash the Ace of Clubs in hand.
 Play 4: Cash the King of Clubs in hand.
 Play 5: Cash the Nine of Clubs in hand.
 Play 6: Cash the Ten of Clubs in dummy.
 Play 7: Cash the Jack of Clubs in dummy.
 Play 8: Cash the Queen of Clubs in dummy.
 Play 9: Cash the Ace of Diamonds in hand.
PLN95: The planning is complete.
---------------------------
PLYTRY: No usable plays found for the current situation.
PLAYDC2: Playing second in dummy, using default player logic.
PLDC2C2: We have no more cards in the suit in dummy, so discard the C2.  <<<<<<<<<< NO THIS will be A WINNER
