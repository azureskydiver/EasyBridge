BLKWD: with 14.0/14.0/14.0 points in the hand, for a total of approx. 31.0-32.0 / 31.0-32.0 pts in the partnership, explore slam possibilities with Blackwood at 4 No Trump.

BK20: Partner responded to our 4NT Blackwood inquiry with 5 Hearts, indicating 2 Aces.
BK32: Our team holds all four aces, but with an estimated 31.0-32.0 total partnership points, we lack the points for a grand slam, so settle for a contract of 6 No Trump.
We bid 6NT.
