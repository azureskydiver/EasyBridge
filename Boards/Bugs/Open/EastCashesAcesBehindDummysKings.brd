====================
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
A00: Have 18.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
A02: But with an openable 5-card Heart suit, prefer to open in the major instead of in No Trump.
E01: Have 18.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Heart.
We bid 1H.
--------------------
South bids 1S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Heart and partner's pass.
B3A20: Partner passed, showing < 6 points, so with 18.0/18.0 points in hand and 18.0-23.0 total partnership points, we have no choice but to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 1 Spade.  Declarer is South; West leads.
=======================
PL03: Starting play as right-hand defender.
PLDF40: Play high with the Queen.
PLYLDRT2: We'd like to return partner's Hearts suit, but dummy will most likely win. <<<< WEST IS VOID!!!!!!
PLCSW9: With no other good options, cash a winner in the Club suit, the Ace
PLYLDA: With no other obvious plays, cash a winner with the CA.
PLYSIG1: Partner discarded low with the five, so consider it a signal that he dislikes the suit.
PLCSW9: With no other good options, cash a winner in the Heart suit, the Ace
RCP5A: West is now known to have started with 1 Heart.
