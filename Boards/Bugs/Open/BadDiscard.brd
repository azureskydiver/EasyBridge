[[File Comments]]
1)East discards 7 from K7. K is after AQ. Has 6 hearts for discarding.!!!
Indicate a preference for the Heart by
discarding high with the H7.
With no cards in the suit led and no trumps,
we discard the S7.
2)East discards 7 leaving K unprotected!!!
Playing fourth, using default player logic.
We can't overtrump North's ten, so discard
the S7.
