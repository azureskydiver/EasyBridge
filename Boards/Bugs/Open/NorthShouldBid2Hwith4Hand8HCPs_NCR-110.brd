North bids 1NT vs 2HT (South's suit)
>>>>>>>> NORTH <<<<<<<<
S:J32  H:K732  D:65  C:A982
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 8.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-0.5;
Total pts = 7.5.
  QT's = 1.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  4 Likely Winners (0/2/0/2)
  9 Likely Losers (3/2/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 1C.
--------------------
South bids 1H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Heart.
REVAL38: (with 4-card Heart trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Diamonds, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 7.5 to 10.5 points)
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Heart suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 18.0-25.0 points.
BN1: With 15.5+ HCPs in the partnership and a reasonably balanced hand, though without stoppers in all suits, bid 1 No Trump.
We bid 1NT.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< WhY NOT 2Hearts???????//
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2S.
