S:KT862  H:32  D:93  C:T643

  Sure Stoppers in: S
  Probable Stoppers in:
  3 Likely Winners (3/0/0/0)

--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Diamond.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
F00: Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
F04: But we have only 3.0/2.0/2.0 points against a minor suit bid, so we prefer to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 2H.

--------------------

REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL5: Adding 3 point(s) for the 2 extra trump(s).
2REVAL38: (with 5-card Spade trump support including a trump honor & doubletons in Diamonds and Hearts, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 2.0 to 9.0 points)
PKF2: With 5 trumps in partner's second suit (Spades), we prefer to support that suit.
B4P42: With 3.0/2.0/9.0 points and 5-card support for partner's second suit (Spades, holding KT862) and a total of 26.0-27.0 pts in the partnership we can bid game at 4 Spades.
We bid 4S.
