>>>>>>>>> NORTH <<<<<<<<<<
S:A3  H:9652  D:AJ75  C:AT3
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 13.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;

  QT's = 3.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  4 Likely Winners (1/0/2/1)
  9 Likely Losers (1/4/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
East bids 1H.
--------------------
South bids 1S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Spade.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Spade suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 20.5-27.5 points.
ROVRC99: We have insufficient strength for either a raise, suit shift, or NT bid, so pass.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<????
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 1 Spade.  Declarer is South; West leads.
