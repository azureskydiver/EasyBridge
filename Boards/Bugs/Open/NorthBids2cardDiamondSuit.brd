North bids a 2 card diamond suit... looking for NT????
==========================
S:AKQT7  H:J64  D:AQ  C:T97
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 16.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-0.5;
Total pts = 15.5.
  QT's = 3.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Likely Winners (5/0/1/-1)
  8 Likely Losers (0/3/1/4)
Playing five-card majors, Spades can be opened.
Have a strong suit in Spades.
Preferred suit is Spades.
====================
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Have 16.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
But with an openable 5-card Spade suit, prefer to open in the major instead of in No Trump.
Have 16.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Spade.
We bid 1S.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Spade and partner's response of 2 Spades.
With a single raise, partner is showing 6.0-10.0 points and decent (3-4 card) support for our Spade suit.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
2REVAL16: (after re-evaluation for distribution, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 15.5 to 16.5 points)
Using the modified trick count, we have 6 playing tricks in hand and a total of 22.5-26.5 points in the partnership, so show the Diamond support suit in a bid of 3 Diamonds.
We bid 3D.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
Partner has returned to our first suit, raising it to 3 Spades.
With 22.5-26.5 points in the partnership and no aspirations for a higher contract, we sign off on partner's bid of 3 Spades.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Spades.  Declarer is North; East leads.
