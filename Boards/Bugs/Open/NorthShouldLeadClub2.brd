  QT's = 3.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, C
  Probable Stoppers in:

Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 1C.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL6: But we don't have a sufficiently strong overcall suit.
A00: Have 14.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
A08: This meet the rqmts for the 1NT opening range (15-17), so bid 1NT.
We bid 1NT.
--------------------
East bids 2S.
--------------------
South bids 3D.
--------------------
West bids 3S.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 No Trump and partner's response of 3 Diamonds.
B3W00a: Partner has made a 2 over 1 bid following an earlier pass, Diamonds over No Trump, which shows 9.0-11.0 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Diamond trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Spades, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 13.5 to 16.0 points)
B3W14: With a balanced distribution, approx. 23.0-25.0 HCPs in the partnership, and  a balanced distribution, bid 2 No Trump in preference to partner's minor.
But our bid (2 No Trump) is too low vs. the last bid of of 3 Spades, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Spades.  Declarer is East; South leads.
=======================
PL03: Starting play as right-hand defender.
PLDF40: Play high with the Queen.   <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<  Pard lead Club here!!!
PLYLDRT2: We'd like to return partner's Clubs suit, but dummy will most likely win.
PLYLD33: Partner has bid the Diamonds suit, so lead the D2.
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Diamonds.
PLDF40a: Play higher with the King.
PLYLDRT8: Return partner's Heart suit with the Ace.
PLYSIG1: Partner discarded low with the six, so consider it a signal that he dislikes the suit.
PLYLDPRF1: Partner likes the Diamond suit, but dummy can ruff, so skip this suit for now.
PLYLDA: With no other obvious plays, cash a winner with the SA.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< NO Lead back partner's last lead _ Club
