Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 13.0, Distn pts = 2.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 13.0.
  QT's = 2.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  7 Likely Winners (2/3/2/0)
  6 Likely Losers (2/1/2/1)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
West bids 3H.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 3 Hearts.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL5: Adding 1 point(s) for the 1 extra trump(s).
2REVAL38: (with 4-card Heart trump support including a trump honor & a singleton in Clubs, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 13.0 to 18.0 points)
SHUTR0: Partner made a preemptive 3 Hearts bid, showing a 7-card Heart suit with no tricks outside the suit, and most likely 5.0-8.0 points.
SHUTR2: We have 13.0/13.0/18.0 points in hand, for a total of 23.0-26.0 points in the partnership, strong support for partner's long Heart suit (holding AK43), plus 2.5 QTs and 7 likely winners, so we can try game at 4 Hearts.
We bid 4H.
--------------------
South bids 5C.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 4 Hearts and partner's pass.
B3A20: Partner passed, showing < 6 points, so with 13.0/13.0 points in hand and 13.0-22.0 total partnership points, we have no choice but to pass.
We pass.

Bidding finished; contract is 5 Clubs.  Declarer is South; West leads.
