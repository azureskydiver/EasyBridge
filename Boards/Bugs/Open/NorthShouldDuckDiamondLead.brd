Planning the play...
Combined hand (Dummy/Hand):
  S:KQJT952 (52/KQJT9)
  H:AKJT975 (AJ9/KT75)

PLN10: We have 9 sure tricks against a requirement of 9 for the 3NT contract.
PLNDRP1: Looking at the hand for drop plays...
PLNDRP5: No drop plays are available.
PLNFNS0: Looking for possible finesses...
PSFNS10: Can finesse the Nine of Hearts in dummy with the Ace as the potential cover card.
PSFNS10: Can finesse the Jack of Hearts in dummy with the Ace as the potential cover card.
PLNFNS90: A total of 2 possible finesses exist.
PLNDEV0: Looking for ways to force out enemy top cards and promote our own......
PLNDEV30: We can play the Ten of Hearts to force out the opponents' Queen.
PLNDEV95: No suit development plays have been found.
PLNCSH1: Looking at the hand for cashes...
PLNCSH3: We can cash 3 cards in Spades, plus 2 in Clubs, plus 1 in Diamonds, plus 3 in Hearts.
PLNCSH30: A total of 9 maximum cashing tricks are immediately available. 4 require cards to have been played
PLYSCN: Reviewing available plays...
PLTSTB: Checking logic of selected plays against bidding history...
PLTSTP: Checking logic of selected plays against play history...
PLNF1: Done examining plays...
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
PLNNT90A: We have 12 plays and approx. 10+ possible tricks including 9 sure tricks (vs. 9 required) accounted for in the plan.
PLNPRI: The Heart suit looks the most promising for further development.
PLSEQ: Checking play sequencing...
PLSEQ5: Since we have enough sure tricks (9) to fulfill the contract, we moved 1 cash plays forward
PINTLV: Interleaving plays...
PINTLV10: Postpone the [HK Cash] so the suit winners in dummy are cashed first, to avoid possible stranding.
PINTLV55: The play: [Finesse the H9] needs to be started from the hand.
PLN90: The tentative list of available plays is as follows:
------>
 Play 1: Lead a low Heart from hand to finesse the nine in dummy against East, with the Ace as cover.
 Play 2: Lead a low Heart from hand to finesse the Jack in dummy against East, with the Ace as cover.
 Play 3: Play the Ten of Hearts from hand to force out the opponents' Queen.
 Play 4: Cash the King of Spades in hand.
 Play 5: Cash the Queen of Spades in hand.
 Play 6: Cash the Jack of Spades in hand.
 Play 7: Cash the Ace of Clubs in hand.
 Play 8: Cash the King of Clubs in dummy.
 Play 9: Cash the Ace of Diamonds in dummy.
 Play 10: Cash the Ace of Hearts in dummy.
 Play 11: Cash the Jack of Hearts in dummy.
 Play 12: Cash the King of Hearts in hand.
PLN95: The planning is complete.
---------------------------
PLYTST8: The play <SK Cash> is not yet viable as the card [Ace] is still outstanding.
PLYTST8: The play <SQ Cash> is not yet viable as the card [Ace] is still outstanding.
PLYTST8: The play <SJ Cash> is not yet viable as the card [Ace] is still outstanding.
PLCSH55: The opponents led a Diamond, so cash the Ace now.
