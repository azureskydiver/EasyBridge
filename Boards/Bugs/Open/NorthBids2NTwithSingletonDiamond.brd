S:KJ5  H:KJ2  D:3  C:AK8532
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 15.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 16.0.
  QT's = 3.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  7 Likely Winners (1/1/0/5)
  6 Likely Losers (2/2/1/1)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Have a strong suit in Clubs.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
E01: Have 15.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Club.
We bid 1C.
--------------------
East bids 1D.
--------------------
South bids 1H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Club and partner's response of 1 Heart.
B3U00: Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid, Hearts over Clubs, which shows 5.0-17.0 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL38: (with 3-card Heart trump support including a trump honor & a singleton in Diamonds, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 16.0 to 18.0 points)
B3U69: With 3-card support for partner's Hearts (holding KJ2), 15.0/16.0/18.0 points, an unbalanced hand, our primary Club suit not jump rebiddable, and no second suit available, bid 2NT.
We bid 2NT.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<??????????????
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3NT.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
BXPNT5: With a total of 20.0-32.0 / 23.0-35.0 pts in the partnership, we lack adequate strength for a further raise beyond partner's 3 No Trump bid, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 No Trump.  Declarer is North; East leads.
