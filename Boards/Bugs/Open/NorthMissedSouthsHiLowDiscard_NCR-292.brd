The best suit is Hearts.
====================
West bids 1S.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL6a: But we don't have a suit strong enough to overcall with at the 2-level.
TKOUT: With 12.0/12.0 points and support for all unbid suits, bid a takeout double.
We bid Dbl.
--------------------
East bids 2D.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 2S.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of Double and partner's pass.
TKRb10: After interference from the left-hand opponent, partner passed our takeout.
B3A20: Partner passed, showing < 6 points, so with 12.0/12.0 points in hand and 12.0-21.0 total partnership points, we have no choice but to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 2NT.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 3S.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Spades.  Declarer is West; North leads.
=======================
PL02: Starting play as left-hand defender.
PLYLEAD: Making opening lead as North against a contract of 3 Spades.
PLYLD15: Lead the HK from the top of the { HA HK } sequence.
PLCSW9: With no other good options, cash a winner in the Heart suit, the Ace
PLYSIG1: Partner discarded low with the four, so consider it a signal that he dislikes the suit.   <<<<<<<<<<<<<< This was a Hi-Low signal 8 then 4
PLYLDB: With no other clear plays available, lead a card from the unbid Club suit.
