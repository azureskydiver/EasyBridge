>>>>>>> WEST <<<<<
S:A653  H:AQT3  D:Q9  C:T65
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 12.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.0;
Total pts = 11.0.
  QT's = 2.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Likely Winners (2/3/0/0)
  8 Likely Losers (2/1/2/3)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suits are  Hearts, Spades
The best suit is Hearts.
====================
Opening bid for team.
E02: Have 12.0 points in high cards and 2.5 quick tricks, so bid 1 Club.
We bid 1C.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 1D.
--------------------
South bids 1H.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Club and partner's response of 1 Diamond.
B3U00: Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid, Diamonds over Clubs, which shows 5.0-17.0 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
B3U30: With a balanced distribution, bid 1 No Trump in preference to partner's minor.

--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
BXPNTJ: Partner jumped to a bid of 3 No Trump over our 1 No Trump, indicating 12.0-22.0 points.
BXPNT5: With a total of 17.0-29.0 / 23.0-33.0 pts in the partnership, we lack adequate strength for a further raise beyond partner's 3 No Trump bid, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 No Trump.  Declarer is West; North leads.
