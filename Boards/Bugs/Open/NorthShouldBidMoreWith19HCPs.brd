>>>>>>>> NORTH<<<<<<<<
S:K93  H:QJ7  D:AK764  C:AQ
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 19.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 19.0.
  QT's = 4.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  7 Likely Winners (1/1/4/1)

Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
A00: Have 19.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
A10: This exceeds the max pts for a 1NT opening (17), but is less than min pts for 2NT (20).  So bid the lowest openable suit of 1 Diamond for now, then try for a jump shift to 2NT later.
We bid 1D.
--------------------
East bids 2S.
--------------------
South bids 3D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Diamond and partner's response of 3 Diamonds.
RDR0: With a single raise, partner is showing 6.0-10.0 points and decent (3-4 card) support for our Diamond suit.
  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> FREEBID shows 10 pts
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
2REVAL16: (after re-evaluation for distribution, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 19.0 to 20.0 points)
R24: We have a total of approx. 25.0-29.0 HCPs in the partnership and all unbid suits stopped, we can bid game at 3 No Trump.
We bid 3NT.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 4D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
BXU00: Partner returned to our agreed Diamond at a bid of 4 Diamonds after we showed the No Trump side suit.
BXU22: With a total of 26.0-30.0 partnership points, we don't have the strength to bid game, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 4 Diamonds.  Declarer is North; East leads.
