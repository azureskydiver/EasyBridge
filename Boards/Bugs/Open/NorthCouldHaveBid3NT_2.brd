>>>>>>>NORTH<<<<<<
S:AK5  H:J7  D:AKQ52  C:KT6
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 20.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-0.5;
Total pts = 19.5.
  QT's = 4.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  8 Likely Winners (2/0/5/1)
  5 Likely Losers (1/2/0/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Have a strong suit in Diamonds.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
Opening bid for team.
A00: Have 20.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
E01: Have 20.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Diamond.
We bid 1D.
--------------------
East passes.

South bids 1NT.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Diamond and partner's response of 1 No Trump.
B3J00: With a 1NT response, partner is showing 5.0-9.0 points, a lack of good support for our Diamond suit, and no other suit available to bid at an appropriate level.
B3J10: And with a balanced hand, we want to steer towards a contract in No Trumps.
B3J23: Have 20.0 HCPS with a balanced hand, and 25.0-29.0 pts in the partnership, but not all suits are stopped, so just bid 2NT.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<????
We bid 2NT.

East passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 2 No Trump.  Declarer is South; West leads.
