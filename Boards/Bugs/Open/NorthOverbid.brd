The best suit is Spades.

F01a: Have 7.0/6.0/6.0 pts with an available 4-card major suit in Spades (QJ83), so bid 1 Spade over partner's minor suit 1 Diamond bid.
We bid 1S.

4REVAL21: Adjusting by 1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 4-card Club trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Diamonds, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 6.0 to 9.0 points)
PKF2: With 4 trumps in partner's second suit (Clubs), we prefer to support that suit.
YN1: With 21.0-27.0 points in the partnership and 4-card support for partner's  Club suit (holding J852), raise to 3 Clubs.
We bid 3C.

REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 5.
3REVAL8: Since the trump suit is only topped by a Queen, deduct 2 points.
2REVAL18: Declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract in Clubs from 6.0 down to 3.0 points)
CUR0: Partner made a cue bid of 3 Diamonds, hinting at slam prospects.
CUR4: But we don't have the points (only 15.0-21.0 pts in the partnership) or the excellent trump support needed for a marginal slam, so we decline by returning to the agreed suit at a bid of 4 Clubs.
We bid 4C.
