North should bid South's first suit: Spades
>>>>>>>>>>  NORTH<<<<<<<<<<<<
S:J42  H:93  D:QJ4  C:QT985
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 6.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.5;
Total pts = 4.5.
  QT's = 0.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  3 Likely Winners (0/0/1/2)
  10 Likely Losers (3/2/2/3)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
West bids 1D.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL3: But we lack the strength with 4.5 pts for a simple overcall.
B00: We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 2C.
--------------------
South bids 2S.
--------------------
West bids 3D.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Spades.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
4REVAL21: Adjusting by 1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Spade trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Hearts, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 4.5 to 7.0 points)
ROVRC5: Partner overcalled at the 2-level, indicating a good 5+ card Spade suit, 9.0-14.0 points, and probably 6+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 16.0-21.0 points.
ROVRC10: This is not enough to bid any higher, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 2 Spades, Pass, and 3 Hearts.
B4P04: Partner bid another suit (third suit in partnership) at 3 Hearts after our Pass response, showing 12.0-18.0 points.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
PKF4: Without a compelling suit of our own, we prefer to support partner's first suit of Spades.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< YES <<<<<<<<<
B4P14: With 6.0/4.5 points in hand, for a total in the partnership of 16.5-22.5 points, and a preference for partner's second suit, we pass.  ??????????????
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Hearts.  Declarer is South; West leads.
