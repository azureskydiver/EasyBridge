Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 14.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-0.5; Total pts = 14.5.
  QT's = 3.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  7 Likely Winners (5/0/1/1)
  6 Likely Losers (1/2/1/2)
Playing five-card majors, Spades can be opened.
Have a strong suit in Spades.
Preferred suit is Spades.
====================
North passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Have 14.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Spade.
We bid 1S.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 2D.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Spade and partner's response of 2 Diamonds.
Partner has made a 2 over 1 bid, Diamonds over Spades, which shows 9.5-17.5 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
With a rebiddable Spade suit and poor support for partner's Diamonds (holding K5), rebid 2 Spades.
We bid 2S.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 4S.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
Partner has bid game in the Spade suit, and with only 24.0-32.0 pts in the partnership, we don't want to raise further, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 4 Spades.  Declarer is East; South leads.
=======================
Playing card from dummy.
Combined hand (Dummy/Hand):

  H:J52 (5/J2)
  D:AKQ87652 (AQ8762/K5)
  C:AQJ8732 (QJ32/A87)
Combined hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 26.0, Distn pts = 2.0;   Total pts = 28.0.

  Stoppers in: S, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  7 Sure Winners (3/0/3/1)
  8 Eventual Winners (3/0/3/2)
  5 Possible Losers (vs. 3 allowable)
Dummy's hand has been laid down; now planning the play with a contract of 4 Spades.
---------------------------
Planning the play...
Combined hand (Dummy/Hand):
  S:AKQT9876 (K7/AQT986)
  H:J52 (5/J2)
  D:AKQ87652 (AQ8762/K5)
  C:AQJ8732 (QJ32/A87)
Combined hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 26.0, Distn pts = 2.0;   Total pts = 28.0.
  QT's = 5.5,
  Stoppers in: S, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  7 Sure Winners (3/0/3/1)
  8 Eventual Winners (3/0/3/2)
  5 Possible Losers (vs. 3 allowable)
We have only 8 sure tricks against a requirement of 10 for the 4S contract.
The Diamond suit looks the most promising for further development.
Checking play sequencing...
We want to work on developing the Diamond suit first, so move its plays up to the front if possible.
Interleaving plays...
The tentative list of available plays is as follows:
------>
 Play 1: Pull a round of trumps with the Ace in hand.
 Play 2: Ruff a Diamond in hand.
 Play 3: Ruff a Diamond in hand.
 Play 4: Ruff a Diamond in hand.
 Play 5: Play the Seven of Diamonds from dummy to force out the opponents' Jack.
 Play 6: Play the Seven of Diamonds from dummy to force out the opponents' Ten.
 Play 7: Cash the King of Diamonds in hand.
 Play 8: Cash the Ace of Diamonds in dummy.
 Play 9: Cash the Queen of Diamonds in dummy.
 Play 10: Ruff a Club in hand.
 Play 11: Ruff a Heart in dummy.
 Play 12: Lead the Club Queen from dummy and finesse it, with the Ace in hand as cover.
 Play 13: Lead a low Club from hand and finesse the Jack in dummy against North.
 Play 14: Lead a low Club from hand and finesse the Queen in dummy against North.
 Play 15: Lead a low Heart from dummy and finesse the Jack in hand against South.
 Play 16: Cash the Ace of Clubs in hand.
 Play 17: Cash the Queen of Clubs in dummy.
 Play 18: Cash the King of Spades in dummy.
 Play 19: Cash the Ace of Spades in hand.
 Play 20: Cash the Queen of Spades in hand.
The planning is complete.
---------------------------
LHO has led the C6, which is the same suit as our CQ finesse card and lower in value, so we can still try the finesse.
Play the finesse card (the Queen) from dummy.
We played the finesse card in second position, so check the results.
Use this opportunity to discard the C7.
Our finesse card (the Queen has held, so discard the C7.
Playing card from dummy.
Reviewing play plan for round 2...
We have only 7 reasonably sure tricks left vs. 9 more trick(s) required for the contract.
Checking play sequencing...
We can fulfill the contract by pulling 5 round(s) of trumps, and cashing the CA, CJ, DA, DK, DQ and D8.
Interleaving plays...
Lead the S7 up to own hand to pull in a round of trumps.
Since LHO may hold the trump Jack, we have to play the Queen.
Reviewing play plan for round 3...
We have only 6 reasonably sure tricks left vs. 8 more trick(s) required for the contract.
Checking play sequencing...
We can fulfill the contract by pulling 3 round(s) of trumps, and cashing the CA, CJ, DA, DK, DQ and D8.
Interleaving plays...
Lead out the SA from hand to pull in a round of trumps. <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<???????????????????//
Playing card from dummy.
Discard the SK on declarer's top Ace of trumps.
Reviewing play plan for round 4...
We have only 4 reasonably sure tricks left vs. 7 more trick(s) required for the contract.
Checking play sequencing...
We want to work on developing the Diamond suit first, so move its plays up to the front if possible.
Interleaving plays...
Lead out the S8 from hand to pull in a round of trumps.
Playing card from dummy.
the ST can't beat the SJ, so skip the cash.
No usable plays found for the current situation.
Use this opportunity to discard the H5.
With no cards in the suit led and no trumps, we discard the H5.
North is now known to have started with 2 Spades.
