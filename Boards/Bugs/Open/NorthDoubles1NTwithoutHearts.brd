>>>>>>> NORTH<<<<<<<
S:K764  H:J  D:AKQ4  C:J876
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 14.0, Distn pts = 2.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-0.5;
Total pts = 13.5.
  QT's = 2.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  7 Likely Winners (2/0/4/1)
  6 Likely Losers (2/1/0/3)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
West bids 1NT.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL6a: But we don't have a suit strong enough to overcall with at the 2-level.
TKOUT: With 14.0/13.5 points and support for all unbid suits, bid a takeout double.   <<<<< UNBID SUITS ??? NT ???
We bid Dbl.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of Double and partner's response of 2 Hearts.
TKORb43: Partner has made a minimum response of 2 Hearts, indicating no more than 9 points.
TKRb49: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 17.5-22.5 pts.
TKRb72: With a total of 17.5-22.5 points in the partnership, we have insufficient strength to raise partner's 2 Hearts bid, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 Hearts.  Declarer is South; West leads.
