Playing five-card majors, Hearts can be opened.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
South bids 1NT.
--------------------
West bids 2S.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 No Trump.
A10: Partner's bid indicates 15-17 points with balanced hand.
E08: Have 11.0/10.5 points with a 5-card major Heart suit, so jump to 3 Hearts.
We bid 3H.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 4D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 No Trump, 3 Hearts, and 4 Diamonds.
B4T02: Partner bid another suit at 4 Diamonds after his opening of 1NT and our response of 3 Hearts.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
B4T29: With 25.5-27.5 points in the partnership but without good support for partner's new Diamond suit (holding AJ), and with no more safe bidding room, we're forced to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 4 Diamonds.  Declarer is South; West leads.
