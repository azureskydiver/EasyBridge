Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL3: But we lack the strength for a simple overcall.
B00: We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.

East bids 1NT.
--------------------
South doubles.
--------------------

TKOTR21: With 8.0/8.0 pts, respond in the major suit of Spades (even though it's not our longest suit) at a bid of 2 Spades.
We bid 2S.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< West opened this suit<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
