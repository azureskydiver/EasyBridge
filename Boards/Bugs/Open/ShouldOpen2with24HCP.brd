thinks he should open only 1 spade with 24 hcp - I did a swap hands to verify.
=============================
Swapped into a new hand.
------------------------
S:AK874  H:AJ2  D:A6  C:AKJ
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 24.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 1.0/0.0;
Total pts = 25.0.
  QT's = 6.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  7 Likely Winners (3/1/1/2)
  6 Likely Losers (2/2/1/1)
Playing five-card majors, Spades can be opened.
Preferred suit is Spades.

====================
***Bidding restarted***
Opening bid for team.
Have 24.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
But with an openable 5-card Spade suit, prefer to open in the major instead of in No Trump.
Have 24.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Spade.
We bid 1S.

North passes.

East bids 2S.
