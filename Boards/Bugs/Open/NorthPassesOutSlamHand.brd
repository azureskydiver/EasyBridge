  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, C
  Probable Stoppers in:

Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Have a strong suit in Clubs.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
E01: Have 19.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Club.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Club and partner's response of 1 Diamond.
B3U00: Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid, Diamonds over Clubs, which shows 5.0-17.0 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL7: Adding 1 point(s) for the solid Club suit.
3REVAL6: Deducting 5 point(s) for the 3 trump(s) short of 3.
B3U74: With less than game-level support for partner's Diamond suit (holding void), but with 19.0/19.0/19.0 points and a second suit in Spades (holding KQ43), show it by jump shifting to 2 Spades.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 4C.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
BXC00: Partner has returned to our first suit, raising it to 4 Clubs.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
3REVAL8: Since the trump suit is only topped by a King, deduct 0 points.
BXC20: With 24.0-36.0 points in the partnership and no aspirations for a higher contract, we sign off on partner's bid of 4 Clubs.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 4 Clubs.  Declarer is North; East leads.
