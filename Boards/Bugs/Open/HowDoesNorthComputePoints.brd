JC32: Partner replied to our Jacoby transfer with 3 Clubs indicating 15-17 points for a total in the partership of 27.0-29.0 points.  <<<<<<<<<<<<????
JC18: We instructed partner to bid Clubs last time because we're not playing 4-suit transfers, so we now want to correct to Diamonds.
JC60: With 10.0/10.0/12.0 points in the hand, and a total in the partnership of 27.0-29.0 points, bid 5 Diamonds.
We bid 5D.
