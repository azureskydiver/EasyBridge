West doubles.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Diamond.
REVAL38: (with 5-card Diamond trump support & doubletons in Clubs and Spades, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 5.0 to 11.0 points)
F01: Partner, opening in third position, is showing 10.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
H30: Have 6.0/5.0/11.0 points and good support for partner's Diamonds (holding 87643), but prefer not to raise a minor, so bid our 4-card major Heart suit instead at ??.
But our bid is too low vs. the last bid of of 1 Diamond, so we have to pass.
We pass.

East bids 1S.
--------------------
South bids 2C.

West passes.
