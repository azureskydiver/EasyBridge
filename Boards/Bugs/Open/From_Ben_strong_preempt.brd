[[File Comments]]
First hand that has really jumped out at me as having a 'real' problem. 
 
As defender, I was perfectly happy to have this hand but I was quite surprised when West bid 3H with only 2HCP while vulnerable!  I happily doubled because (vulnerable), I didn't want to chance 4C.  As I understand it, a preemptive bid needs to have 6HCP plus some distribution points.
