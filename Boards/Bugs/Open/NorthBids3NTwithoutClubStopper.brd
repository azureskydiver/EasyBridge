F00: Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
G64: We have 8.0/9.0/9.0 points with poor support for partner's Spade suit (holding 8) and not enough strength for a 2/1 response to show our Diamond suit, so bid 1NT.
But our bid is too low vs. the last bid of of 2 No Trump, so we have to pass.
We pass.
