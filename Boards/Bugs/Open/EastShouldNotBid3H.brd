Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Club and partner's response of 2 Diamonds.
B3W00a: Partner has made a 2 over 1 bid following an earlier pass, Diamonds over Clubs, which shows 9.0-11.0 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Diamond trump support including a trump honor & a singleton in Spades, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 11.0 to 14.0 points)
B3W40: With moderate support for partner's minor Diamond suit (holding AT9), and our first suit not rebiddable, we have to shift to another suit at 3 Hearts.  <<<<< Or pass???????
We bid 3H.
