====================
South bids 2S.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL6a: But we don't have a suit strong enough to overcall with at the 3-level.
TKOUT: With 21.0/21.0 points and support for all unbid suits, bid a takeout double.
We bid Dbl.
--------------------
North bids 3C.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of Double and partner's pass.
TKOUT: With 21.0/21.0 points and support for all unbid suits, bid a takeout doubleagain.
We bid Dbl.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 3H.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of Double and partner's response of 3 Hearts.
TKORb43: Partner has made a minimum response of 3 Hearts, indicating no more than 9 points.
TKRb49: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 23.0-30.0 pts.
TKRb72: With a total of 23.0-30.0 points in the partnership, we have insufficient strength to raise partner's 3 Hearts bid, so we have to pass.
We pass.  <<<<<<<<<<<< GAME ??????????
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Hearts.  Declarer is East; South leads.
