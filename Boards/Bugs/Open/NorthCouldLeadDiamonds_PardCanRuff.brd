Have a powerful suit in Diamonds.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 2S.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL6a: But we don't have a suit strong enough to overcall with at the 3-level.
B00: We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 2NT.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 3S.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Spades.  Declarer is West; North leads.
=======================
PL02: Starting play as left-hand defender.
PLYLEAD: Making opening lead as North against a contract of 3 Spades.
PLYLD15: Lead the DK from the top of the { DA DK } sequence.
PLYSIG0: Partner discarded high with the seven, so consider it a suit preference signal.
PLYLDPRF4: Partner has indicated a preference for the Diamonds suit, so lead the DA.
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Diamonds.
PLYSIG6: Partner discarded low with the four after discarding the seven last round, thus marking a high-low suit preference signal.
PLYLDPRF1: Partner likes the Diamond suit, but dummy can ruff, so skip this suit for now.  
PLYLDWN2: We'd like to lead the Diamonds suit, but dummy might ruff. <<<<<<<<<<<<<  Maybe Pard can OVER RUFF <<<<<<
PLCSW9: With no other good options, cash a winner in the Heart suit, the Ace
PLYLDA: With no other obvious plays, cash a winner with the HA.
