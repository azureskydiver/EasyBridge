>>>>>>> NORTH<<<<<<<<<,
S:AQT76  H:KJT  D:T7  C:KJ4
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 14.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;

  QT's = 2.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  6 Likely Winners (4/1/0/1)
  7 Likely Losers (1/2/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, Spades can be opened.
Preferred suit is Spades.
====================
***Bidding restarted***
South bids 1S.
--------------------
West bids 3C.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Spade.
(with 5-card Spade trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Diamonds, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 14.0 to 19.0 points)
Partner opened 1 Spade, and with 19.0 pts in hand and 5-card trump support, we can bid Jacoby 2NT to ask for partner's strength.
But our bid (2 No Trump) is too low vs. the last bid of of 3 Clubs, so we have to pass.  <<<<<<<<<<< NO bec of West's interference
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
