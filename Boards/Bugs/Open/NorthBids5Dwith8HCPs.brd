JC16: Partner replied to our Jacoby transfer with a jump response of 4 Clubs, indicating max 2NT opening points (21) and 4+ trumps, for a total partnership holding of 28.5-28.5 points and 4+ trumps.
JC18: We instructed partner to bid Clubs last time because we're not playing 4-suit transfers, so we now want to correct to Diamonds.
