West overbids hand at 5D
>>>>>>>> WEST <<<<<<<
S:85  H:AQ  D:AKT73  C:AKQ3
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 22.0, Distn pts = 2.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 22.0.
  QT's = 5.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  9 Likely Winners (0/1/4/4)
  4 Likely Losers (2/1/1/0)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suits are  Clubs, Diamonds
The best suit is Diamonds.
====================
South bids 1S.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCTK: With 22.0/22.0 points, the hand is too strong for a simple overcall, so start by doubling.
We bid Dbl.
--------------------
North bids 2S.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of Double and partner's pass.
TKOUT: With 22.0/22.0 points and support for all unbid suits, bid a takeout doubleagain.
We bid Dbl.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 3H.
--------------------
South bids 3S.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of Double and partner's response of 3 Hearts.
TKORb43: Partner has made a minimum response of 3 Hearts, indicating no more than 9 points.
TKRb49: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 26.0-31.0 pts.
TKRb51: The right-hand opponent has bid after partner's response, interfering with our communication.
TKRb90: Partner's forced response of 3 Hearts not withstanding, we can now show the Diamond suit that we wanted to overcall with last round by bidding 5 Diamonds.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< Why 5 vs 4 ???????????????
We bid 5D.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 5 Diamonds.  Declarer is West; North leads.
