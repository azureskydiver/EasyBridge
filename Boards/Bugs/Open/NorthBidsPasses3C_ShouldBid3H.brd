>>>>>>> NORTH <<<<<<<<<<<<<
S:42  H:KQ763  D:K7  C:JT98
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 9.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.0;

  QT's = 1.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  6 Likely Winners (0/4/1/1)

Playing five-card majors, Hearts can be opened.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
South bids 1H.
--------------------
West doubles.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Heart.
REVAL38: (with 5-card Heart trump support including a trump honor & doubletons in Diamonds and Spades, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 8.0 to 15.0 points)
F00: Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
I08: Have 9.0/8.0/15.0 points with 5-card support for partner's Hearts (holding KQ763), which is too strong for a limit raise, so we have to temporarily shift to Clubs with a bid of 2 Clubs.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3C.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Heart, 2 Clubs, and 3 Clubs.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 5.
3REVAL8: Since the trump suit is only topped by a four, deduct 2 points.
2REVAL18: Declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 8.0 down to 5.0 points)
B4H14: Partner made a single raise of our 2 Clubs bid to 3 Clubs, showing 12.0 -18.0 points and 3+ trump cards.
B4H30: With only 9.0/8.0/5.0 pts in hand, for a total in the partnership of 17.0-23.0 points, a game is unlikely, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
