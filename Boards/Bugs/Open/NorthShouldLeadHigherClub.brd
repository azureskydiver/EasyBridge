Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 10.0, Distn pts = 3.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.5;
Total pts = 8.5.
  QT's = 1.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Likely Winners (2/0/0/3)
  8 Likely Losers (2/1/2/3)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suits are  Clubs, Spades
The best suit is Clubs.
====================
Opening bid for team.
Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1C.
--------------------
West doubles.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Club.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL5: Adding 5 point(s) for the 3 extra trump(s).
2REVAL38: (with 6-card Club trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Diamonds,  & a singleton in Hearts, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 8.5 to 16.5 points)
F01: Partner, opening in third position, is showing 10.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
I20: Have 10.0/8.5/16.5 points and strong support for partner's minor Club suit (holding Q96432).  Although we'd prefer not to raise a minor, we have no other good options, so raise to 2 Clubs.
We bid 2C.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West doubles.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 2 Clubs and partner's pass.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
3REVAL5: Adding 1 point(s) for the 1 extra trump(s).
3REVAL8: Since the trump suit is only topped by a Ace, deduct 1 points.
2REVAL10: (with a 6-card trump suit in Clubs, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 8.5 to 11.5 points)
B3A20: Partner passed, showing < 6 points, so with 10.0/8.5 points in hand and 11.5-16.5 total partnership points, we have no choice but to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 2H.
--------------------
South passes.

We passed and partner passed, so pass again.

RCP5A: West is now known to have started with 1 Club.

PLYLDPRF2: Partner likes the Club suit, but declarer has shown out of the suit and _may_ be able to ruff, so avoid leading the suit if possible.

RCP20: Dummy is now out of Clubs.
