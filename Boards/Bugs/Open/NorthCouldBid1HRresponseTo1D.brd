F00: Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
H08: Have 11.0/10.0/10.0 points  but prefer to show our own Club suit instead of raising a minor, so bid 2 Clubs.

Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Diamond, 2 Clubs, and 3 Clubs.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 5.
3REVAL8: Since the trump suit is only topped by a King, deduct 0 points.
2REVAL18: Declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 10.0 down to 9.0 points)
B4H14: Partner made a single raise of our 2 Clubs bid to 3 Clubs, showing 12.0 -18.0 points and 3+ trump cards.
B4H35: We have a total of approx. 21.0-27.0 in the partnership, but we do not have a rebiddable suit, nor do we have enough stoppers for a NT contract, so we have to sign off on partner's 3 Clubs bid.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 3 Clubs.  Declarer is North; East leads.
