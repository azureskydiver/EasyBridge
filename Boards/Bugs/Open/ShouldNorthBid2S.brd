>>>>>>>>> NORTH<<<<<<<<<<<<
S:JT6  H:T  D:KT62  C:KT653
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 7.0, Distn pts = 2.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.0;
Total pts = 6.0.
  QT's = 1.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  3 Likely Winners (0/0/1/2)
  10 Likely Losers (3/1/3/3)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
Opening bid for team.
Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 1C.
--------------------
South bids 1S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Spade.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
4REVAL21: Adjusting by 1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Spade trump support including a trump honor & a singleton in Hearts, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 6.0 to 9.0 points)
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Spade suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 16.0-23.0 points.
ROVRC99: We have insufficient strength for either a raise, suit shift, or NT bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 1 Spade.  Declarer is South; West leads.
