  QT's = 4.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, D, C

Playing five-card majors, Hearts can be opened.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
A00: Have 17.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
A02: But with an openable 5-card Heart suit, prefer to open in the major instead of in No Trump.
E01: Have 17.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Heart.
We bid 1H.
--------------------
East bids 1S.
--------------------
South bids 2D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Heart and partner's response of 2 Diamonds.
B3W00: Partner has made a 2 over 1 bid, Diamonds over Hearts, which shows 9.0-17.0 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Diamond trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Spades, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 16.5 to 18.5 points)
B3W59: With weak support for partner's Diamonds (holding KQ5) and no good second suit, we have show our strength by jump shifting in Notrumps to 3 No Trump, despite the unbalanced hand.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<?????????????
We bid 3NT.
