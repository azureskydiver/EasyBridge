North's comments about Unusual 2NT is WRONG  South has Clubs and Diamonds NOT Hearts
>>>>>>>> NORTH <<<<<<
S:T8  H:AQ7643  D:T6  C:AT5
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 10.0, Distn pts = 3.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 11.0.
  QT's = 2.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  6 Likely Winners (0/5/0/1)
  7 Likely Losers (2/1/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, Hearts can be opened.
Have a strong suit in Hearts.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
Opening bid for team.
Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 1S.
--------------------
South bids 2NT.
--------------------
West bids 3S.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 No Trump.
UNTR10: Partner has made an Unusual NT bid of 2 No Trump, indicating 5/5 length in Hearts and Clubs. <<<<<<????
UNTR12: Given a choice, we prefer the Club suit.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
2REVAL16: (after re-evaluation for distribution, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 11.0 to 12.0 points)
UNTR28: With a total of 18.0-23.0 pts in the partnership, respond at the 3-level with 3 Clubs.
But our bid (3 Clubs) is too low vs. the last bid of of 3 Spades, so we have to pass.
We pass.

East passes.
