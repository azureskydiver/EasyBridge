>>>>>>>> NORTH <<<<<<<
S:QT9  H:AQ94  D:4  C:Q8765
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 10.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 10.0.
  QT's = 1.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  7 Likely Winners (1/3/0/3)
  6 Likely Losers (2/1/1/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
South bids 1H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Heart.
REVAL38: (with 4-card Heart trump support including a trump honor & a singleton in Diamonds, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 10.0 to 15.0 points)
F00: Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
I08: Have 10.0/10.0/15.0 points with 4-card support for partner's Hearts (holding AQ94), which is too strong for a limit raise, so we have to temporarily shift to Clubs with a bid of 2 Clubs.
We bid 2C.
--------------------
East bids 2S.
--------------------
South bids 3D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Heart, 2 Clubs, and 3 Diamonds.
PKF1: With 4 trumps in partner's first suit (Hearts), we prefer to support that suit.
B4Q02: Partner made a jump shift to 3 Diamonds in response to our 2 Clubs bid, showing 19.0-22.0 points.  The bid is forcing to game.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
BN1: With 29.0+ HCPs in the partnership and a reasonably balanced hand, and all unbid suits stopped, bid 3 No Trump.
We bid 3NT.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 4H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
BXL05: Partner has bid yet another suit, Hearts.
BXL36: Without the strength to push further at 29.0-32.0 total team points, pass and accept the contract of 4 Hearts.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 4 Hearts.  Declarer is South; West leads.
