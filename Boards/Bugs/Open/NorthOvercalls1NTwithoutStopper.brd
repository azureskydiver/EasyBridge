====================
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 1D.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL6: But we don't have a sufficiently strong overcall suit.
A00: Have 14.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
A08: This meet the rqmts for the 1NT opening range (15-17), so bid 1NT.  <<<<<<<<< STOPPER for Diamonds??????????
We bid 1NT.    
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3NT.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 No Trump and partner's response of 3 No Trump.
NT10: Partner's raise from our 1 No Trump to 3 No Trump indicates a balanced hand and 9.0-15.0 HCPs, for a total of 23.0+ HCPs in the partnership.
B3N12: But with only about 23.0-29.0 HCPS in the partnership, we don't have enough for game, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
