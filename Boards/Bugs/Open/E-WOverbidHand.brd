REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 6 point(s) for the 3 trump(s) short of 3.
Partner is showing 12.0-20.0 points and 2+ QT's.
Have 9.0/9.0/9.0 pts with an available 5-card major suit in Hearts (AT863), so bid 1 Heart over partner's minor suit 1 Diamond bid.

--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Diamond, 1 Heart, and 2 Spades.
With 3 trumps in partner's second suit (Spades), we prefer to support that suit.
Partner made a jump shift to 2 Spades in response to our 1 Heart bid, showing 19.0-22.0 points.  The bid is forcing to game.
Adjusting by 1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Spade trump support including a trump honor & a void in Diamonds, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 9.0 to 13.0 points)
with 9.0/9.0/13.0 points in the hand, for a total of approx. 28.0-31.0 / 32.0-35.0 pts in the partnership, explore slam possibilities with Blackwood at 4 No Trump.
We pick Spades for the ultimate slam contract suit.
We bid 4NT.

Our team holds all four aces, but with an estimated 32.0-35.0 total partnership points, we lack the points for a grand slam, so settle for a contract of 6 Spades.
We bid 6S.
