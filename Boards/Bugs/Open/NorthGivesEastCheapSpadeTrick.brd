====================
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
E01: Have 13.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Diamond.
We bid 1D.
--------------------
East doubles.
--------------------
South bids 1S.
--------------------
West bids 2H.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Diamond and partner's response of 1 Spade.
B3U00a: Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid after an earlier pass, Spades over Diamonds, which shows 5.0-11.0 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL5: Adding 1 point(s) for the 1 extra trump(s).
2REVAL38: (with 4-card Spade trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Hearts, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 13.0 to 16.0 points)
B3U14: With decent 4-card support for partner's major Spade suit (holding J763), no rebiddable suit, and no openable second suit, raise to 2 Spades.
We bid 2S.
--------------------
East bids 3H.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 4H.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 2 Spades and partner's pass.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 5.
3REVAL8: Since the trump suit is only topped by a Jack, deduct 2 points.
2REVAL18: Declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract in Spades from 13.0 down to 10.0 points)
B3A20: Partner passed, showing < 6 points, so with 13.0/13.0 points in hand and 10.0-19.0 total partnership points, we have no choice but to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.

South passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 4 Hearts.  Declarer is West; North leads.
=======================
PL02: Starting play as left-hand defender.
PLYLEAD: Making opening lead as North against a contract of 4 Hearts.
PLYLD4: Lead the bottom card of partner's Spade suit (the three.
RCP5A: West is now known to have started with 0 Spades.
PLAYDF2: Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
PLDF2H5: Cover with the winner Ace.
PLDF2H3: Cover with the Ace.
PLYLDPRF2: Partner likes the Spade suit, but declarer has shown out of the suit and _may_ be able to ruff, so avoid leading the suit if possible.
PLYLD33: Partner has bid the Spades suit, so lead the S6.   <<<<<<<<<<<< NO Dummy's ST will win
