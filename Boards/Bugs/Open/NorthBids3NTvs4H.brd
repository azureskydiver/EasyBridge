S:K93  H:T98543  D:K95  C:T
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 6.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.0;
Total pts = 5.0.
  QT's = 1.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  4 Likely Winners (1/2/1/0)
  9 Likely Losers (2/4/2/1)
Playing five-card majors, Hearts can be opened.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
South bids 1H.
--------------------
West doubles.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Heart.
REVAL38: (with 6-card Heart trump support & a singleton in Clubs, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 5.0 to 14.0 points)
F00: Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
I08: Have 6.0/5.0/14.0 points with 6-card support for partner's Hearts (holding T98543), which is too strong for a limit raise, so we have to temporarily shift to Spades with a bid of 1 Spade.
--------------------
East bids 2D.
--------------------
South bids 3C.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Heart, 1 Spade, and 3 Clubs.
PKF1: With 6 trumps in partner's first suit (Hearts), we prefer to support that suit.
B4Q02: Partner made a jump shift to 3 Clubs in response to our 1 Spade bid, showing 19.0-22.0 points.  The bid is forcing to game.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
BN1: With 25.0+ HCPs in the partnership and a reasonably balanced hand, and all unbid suits stopped, bid 3 No Trump.
