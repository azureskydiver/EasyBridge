RWKT40: We have 19.0/19.0/19.0 points, for a partnership total of 24.0-29.0 points, so we may be interested in a possible slam.
RWKT46: And we have a balanced hand with all unbid suits stopped, so move towards slam.
BLKWD: with 19.0/19.0/19.0 points in the hand, for a total of approx. 24.0-29.0 / 24.0-29.0 pts in the partnership, explore slam possibilities with Blackwood at 4 No Trump.
