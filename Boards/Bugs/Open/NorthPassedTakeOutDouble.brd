N passed Souths take  out double... sounds like it lost the fact is was a double as analysis says that South opened.
================================
S:976  H:86  D:642  C:J8743
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 1.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.0;
Total pts = 0.0.
  QT's = 0.0,
  Sure Stoppers:
  Probable Stoppers in: C
  0 Likely Winners (-1/0/-1/2)
  13 Likely Losers (4/2/4/3)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
Opening bid for team.
Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 1NT.
--------------------
South doubles.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening double.
Partner, opening in fourth position, is showing 10.0-18.5 points and 2+ QT's.
But we have only 1.0/0.0/0.0 points against a minor suit bid, so we prefer to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 1 No Trump (doubled).  Declarer is East; South leads.
