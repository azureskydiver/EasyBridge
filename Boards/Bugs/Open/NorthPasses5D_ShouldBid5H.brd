====================
West bids 1S.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL6a: But we don't have a suit strong enough to overcall with at the 2-level.
B00: We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 2S.
--------------------
South bids 3H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 3 Hearts.
REVAL38: (with 4-card Heart trump support including a trump honor & a singleton in Diamonds, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 15.0 to 20.0 points)
F01: Partner, opening in fourth position, is showing 10.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
J10: Have 15.0/15.0/20.0 points; show strength by jump shifting to 4 Spades.
We bid 4S.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 5D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 3 Hearts, 4 Spades, and 5 Diamonds.
B4P04: Partner bid another suit (third suit in partnership) at 5 Diamonds after our jump response, showing 12.0-18.0 points.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
PKF1: With 4 trumps in partner's first suit (Hearts), we prefer to support that suit.
B4P40a: We have 1-card support for partner's first suit (Diamonds, holding 4), but with only 27.0-33.0 pts in the partnership, we can't raise partner beyond his 5 Diamonds bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
