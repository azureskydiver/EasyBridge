South bids 2S and West then bids 3S..... when W opened 1D and E bid 2C.... South just bid out of nothing.... but then West bid 3 of his suit.....
=====
West analysis - didn't seem to consider that South had just bid Spades...
Starting play from restored game.

***Bidding restarted***
Opening bid for team.
E01: Have 17.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Diamond.
We bid 1D.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 2C.
--------------------
South bids 2S.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Diamond and partner's response of 2 Clubs.
B3W00: Partner has made a 2 over 1 bid, Clubs over Diamonds, which shows 9.0-17.0 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
B3W40: With poor support for partner's minor Club suit (holding K), and our first suit not rebiddable, we have to shift to another suit at 3 Spades.
We bid 3S.   <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< ???????? See South's bid.  Try 2NT
