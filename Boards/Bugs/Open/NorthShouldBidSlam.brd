Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Heart and partner's response of 2 Clubs.
B3W00a: Partner has made a 2 over 1 bid following an earlier pass, Clubs over Hearts, which shows 9.5-11.5 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL38: (with 3-card Club trump support including a trump honor & a singleton in Diamonds, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 20.0 to 22.0 points)
B3W59: With weak support for partner's Clubs (holding KJ6) and no good second suit, we have show our strength by jump shifting in Notrumps to 3 No Trump, despite the unbalanced hand.
We bid 3NT.
