Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Spades.
====================
North bids 2S.
--------------------
East doubles.
--------------------
South bids 3NT.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
B00: We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 No Trump.  Declarer is South; West leads.
=======================
PL02: Starting play as left-hand defender.
PLYLEAD: Making opening lead as West against a contract of 3 No Trump.
PLYLD4A: Lead the fourth card from our best suit (Spades) -- play the S2.
PLYSIG0: Partner discarded high with the seven, so consider it a suit preference signal.
PLAYB48: We can't beat South's Jack, so discard the C3.
PLAYDF2: Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
PLDF2H1: Play second hand low with the two.
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Hearts.
PLDIS2: Since we can win the next round of Diamonds, we want to signal by discarding high in the suit.
PLDIS8: Begin the high-low signal with the six.
PLDF36: Partner's Queen is high or we can't beat the highest card, so discard the D6.
PLDF36: Partner's King is high or we can't beat the highest card, so discard the D5.
RCP5A: South is now known to have started with 2 Diamonds.
PLDF25: Play our only card in the suit, the Ace.
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Diamonds.
PLYLDPRF8: Partner has indicated a preference for the Spades suit, so lead the S5.
PLYLD76: Continue developing our Spade suit by playing the SK.
