PLN10: We have only 11 sure tricks against a requirement of 12 for the 6NT contract.
PLNPRI: The Heart suit looks the most promising for further development.
PLSEQ: Checking play sequencing...
PLSEQ6: We want to work on developing the Heart suit first, so move its plays up to the front if possible.
PINTLV: Interleaving plays...
PINTLV70: Try to cross over to hand with the [DJ Cash] when possible to use the [HK Finesse].
PLN90: The tentative list of available plays is as follows:
------>
 Play 1: Cash the Jack of Diamonds in hand.
 Play 2: Lead a low Heart from hand and finesse the King in dummy against North.  <<<<<<<<<<< Better to finesse for HQ by playing HJ ???
 Play 3: Cash the King of Hearts in dummy.
 Play 4: Cash the Ace of Spades in hand.
 Play 5: Cash the King of Spades in hand.
 Play 6: Cash the King of Clubs in hand.
 Play 7: Cash the Queen of Clubs in hand.
 Play 8: Cash the Jack of Clubs in hand.
 Play 9: Cash the Ace of Clubs in dummy.
 Play 10: Cash the Queen of Diamonds in dummy.
 Play 11: Cash the King of Diamonds in dummy.
 Play 12: Cash the Ace of Diamonds in dummy.
PLN95: The planning is complete.
---------------------------
PLCSH56: Discard a Diamond from dummy in anticipation of cashing the Jack in hand.
PLCSH80: the opponents led a Diamond, so see if we can finish up the cash play here.
PLCSH85: We can actually play the nine to win this trick, so postpone the cash of the Jack.
PLYTRY: No usable plays found for the current situation.
PLYE41: Play the nine to win the trick.
PLNADJ: Reviewing play plan for round 2...
PLRV10: We have only 9 reasonably sure tricks left vs. 11 more trick(s) required for the contract.
PLSEQ: Checking play sequencing...
PLSEQ6: We want to work on developing the Heart suit first, so move its plays up to the front if possible.
PINTLV: Interleaving plays...
PL3FN12: Lead a low Heart (the four) from hand to finesse the King in dummy.
PLDM: Playing card from dummy.
PLCSH74: Finesse the HK from dummy.
