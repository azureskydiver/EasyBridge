3REVAL7: Adding 7 point(s) for the solid Spade suit.
SHUTR0: Partner made a preemptive 3 Hearts bid, showing a 7-card Heart suit with no tricks outside the suit, and most likely 5.0-8.0 points.
SHUTR9: With 16.0/19.5/19.5 points in hand, for a total of 24.5-27.5 points in the partnership, holding AT in support of partner's Heart suit, and with only 3.0 QTs and 9 likely winners, we have no real reason to bid anything, so just pass.
