Planning the play...
Combined hand (Dummy/Hand):
  S:AKQ85 (/AKQ85)
  H:AKQJ8432 (KQ8432/AJ)

  Probable Stoppers in:
  7 Sure Winners (3/4/0/0)
  11 Eventual Winners (3/4/1/3)
  2 Possible Losers (vs. 2 allowable)
PLN10: We have 11 sure tricks against a requirement of 11 for the 5C contract.
PLNDRP1: Looking at the hand for drop plays...
PLNDRP1: Can play the Ace of Hearts in hand to try and drop the opponents' ten.
PLNDRP5: One drop play is available.
PLNFNS0: Looking for possible finesses...
PLNFNS95: No immediate finesses have been found.
PLNDEV0: Looking for ways to force out enemy top cards and promote our own......
PLNDEV95: No suit development plays have been found.
PLNRF0: Looking for ruffing tricks...
PLNRF1: We can potentially ruff up to 1 Spade in dummy.
PLNRF1: We can potentially ruff up to 2 Hearts in hand.
PLNRF1: We can potentially ruff up to 1 Diamond in hand after discarding the 1 loser from hand.
PLNRF5: Up to 4 ruffs can be used (1 in dummy/3 in hand) out of a total of 7 available, but require 1 discard(s) first.
PLNRF8: This consists of the { DT } from hand.
PLNCSH1: Looking at the hand for cashes...
PLNCSH3: We can cash 1 card in Diamonds, plus 4 in Hearts, plus 3 in Spades, plus 3 in Clubs.
PLNCSH30: A total of 11 maximum cashing tricks are immediately available. 4 require cards to have been played
PLNTRMP: Evaluating the trumps situation...
PLNTRMP5: We can safely play up to 4 rounds of trumps without endangering the contract.
PLNTRMP8: However, this may not pull in all 5 outstanding trump(s).
PLNTRMP9: This will result in (up to) 4 rounds of trumps, 7 cashing tricks in the side suits, and up to 4 ruffing tricks.
PLYSCN: Reviewing available plays...
PLTSTP: Checking logic of selected plays against play history...
PLNF1: Done examining plays...
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
PLNST90B: We have 20 possible plays and up to 13 possible tricks including 11 sure tricks (vs. 11 required) accounted for in the plan.
PLNPRI: The Heart suit looks the most promising for further development.
PLSEQ: Checking play sequencing...
PLSEQ20: We can fulfill the contract by pulling 3 round(s) of trumps, cashing the DQ, HA, HK, HQ, HJ, SA and SK, and ruffing 1 card(s).
PINTLV: Interleaving plays...
PINTLV10: Postpone the [HK Cash] so the suit winners in hand are cashed first, to avoid possible stranding.
PINTLV10: Postpone the [HQ Cash] so the suit winners in hand are cashed first, to avoid possible stranding.
PLN90: The tentative list of available plays is as follows:

 Play 2: Pull a round of trumps with the Queen in hand.
 Play 3: Pull a round of trumps with the Jack in hand.
