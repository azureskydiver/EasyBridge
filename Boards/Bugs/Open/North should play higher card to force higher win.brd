North really should play higher spade even if Souths S5 is winning... to force higher in declarer. In this case it didn't make any difference but it could...

====================
East bids 1H.
--------------------
South bids 1NT.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 No Trump.
Partner's bid indicates 15-17 points with balanced hand.
Responding with a reasonably balanced hand and 3.0 HCP's, for a total in partnership of 18.0-20.0 HCPs.
We do not have quite enough for game even if partner has max opening points, so pass.
We pass.

East bids 1H.

South doubles.

Opening bid for team.
Partner has doubled for takeout.
Partner's takeout indicates 11.5+ HCPs, for a total in the partnership of 13.0-23.0 points.
But Right-hand opponent has bid after partner's double, so the takeout is no longer in effect.
And with only 3.0/1.5 points, we choose to pass.
We pass.

East bids 1NT.

South passes.

West passes.

We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.

=======================
Starting play as right-hand defender.
We do not have a winner in the Spade suit, so discard low with the two.
Partner's six is high or we can't beat the highest card, so discard the S2.
