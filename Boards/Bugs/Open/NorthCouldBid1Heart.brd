====================
East bids 1C.
--------------------
South bids 1D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Diamond.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Diamond suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 12.0-19.0 points.
ROVRC10: This is not enough to bid any higher, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
