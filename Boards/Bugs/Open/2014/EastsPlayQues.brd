====================
South bids 1NT.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North bids 2C.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
But we lack the strength with 7.0 pts for a simple overcall.
We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
South bids 2S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North bids 2NT.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.
--------------------
South bids 4S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 4 Spades.  Declarer is South; West leads.
=======================
Starting play as right-hand defender.
Play high with the King.
With no other good options, cash a winner in the Heart suit, the Ace
With no good card to lead, lead the DT since the opponents have not shown out of the Diamond suit.
South is now known to have started with 1 Diamond.
Dummy is now out of Diamonds.
We can't beat North's Queen, so discard the S3.
Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
As second hand, play the lowest card we have in the suit, the five.
West is now known to have started with 2 Spades.
Dummy is now out of Spades.
Play the Ace to win the trick.
With no other clear plays available, lead a card from the unbid Heart suit.
Partner's Ace can win the trick, so discard the C2.
We do not have a winner in the Diamond suit, so discard low with the four.
Partner's DA can win the trick, so discard the D4.
