We have only 7 sure tricks against a requirement of 10 for the 4S contract.
The Heart suit looks the most promising for further development.
Checking play sequencing...
We want to work on developing the Heart suit first, so move its plays up to the front if possible.
Interleaving plays...
The tentative list of available plays is as follows:
------>
 Play 1: Pull a round of trumps with the Ace in hand.
 Play 2: Pull a round of trumps with the King in hand.
 Play 3: Ruff a Heart in hand.
 Play 4: Ruff a Heart in hand.
 Play 5: Lead a low Heart from hand to finesse the ten in dummy against West, with the { HA HK  } as possible cover cards.
 Play 6: Lead a low Heart from hand to finesse the Jack in dummy against West, with the { HA HK  } as possible cover cards.
 Play 7: Play the Jack of Hearts from dummy to force out the opponents' Queen.
 Play 8: Play the Jack of Hearts from dummy to force out the opponents' Nine.
 Play 9: Play the Jack of Hearts from dummy to force out the opponents' Six.
 Play 10: Cash the Ace of Hearts in dummy.
 Play 11: Cash the King of Hearts in dummy.
 Play 12: Ruff a Club in hand.
 Play 13: Ruff a Club in hand.
 Play 14: Lead a low Club from hand and finesse the Jack in dummy against West.
 Play 15: Cash the Ace of Spades in hand.
 Play 16: Cash the King of Spades in hand.
 Play 17: Cash the Queen of Spades in hand.
 Play 18: Cash the Ace of Diamonds in hand.
The planning is complete.
