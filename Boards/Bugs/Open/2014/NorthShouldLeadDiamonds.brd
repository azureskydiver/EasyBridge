4REVAL21: Adjusting by 1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Spade trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Hearts, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 7.0 to 9.0 points.
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Spade suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 16.5-23.5 points.
ROVRC99: We have insufficient strength for either a raise, suit shift, or NT bid, so pass.
We pass.

B4C10: With 7.0/7.0 points in the hand, for a total in the partnership of 19.0-25.0 points, we have to settle for the current bid and pass.
We pass.
--------------------

PLDF2H1: Play second hand low with the two.
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Spades.
PLDF36: Partner's King is high or we can't beat the highest card, so discard the S3.

PLYLD44: With no other obvious plays, lead a low trump H4.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<NO Return pard's suit
