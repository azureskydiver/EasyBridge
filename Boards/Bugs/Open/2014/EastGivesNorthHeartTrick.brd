[[File Comments]]
East gives North Heart trick
>>EAST<<<<<<<<
PL03: Starting play as right-hand defender.
PLDF25: Play our only card in the suit, the six.
PLAYB48: We can't beat South's Ace, so discard the SJ.
RCP5A: West is now known to have started with 0 Hearts.
PLYSIG20: Partner discarded high in the Diamond suit, indicating a preference for that suit.
PLAYB48: We can't beat North's Ace, so discard the H4.
PLAYDF2: Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
PLDF2G1: There's only one more card outstanding card in the suit, so win here with the eight.
PLYLD32: Partner is void in Hearts and may still have some trumps, so lead the H5.  <<<<<<<< West played ST last???
