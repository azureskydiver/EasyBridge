====================
West bids 1NT.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
But we lack the strength with 7.5 pts for a simple overcall.
We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.

East bids 2D.
--------------------
South doubles.
--------------------
West bids 2H.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening double.
Partner has doubled for takeout.
Partner's takeout indicates 11.5+ HCPs, for a total in the partnership of 19.0-29.0 points.
But Right-hand opponent has bid after partner's double, so the takeout is no longer in effect.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer for Spade contract...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 5.
