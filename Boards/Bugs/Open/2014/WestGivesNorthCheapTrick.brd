PLAYB41: Play the King to win the trick.
PLYLDB: With no other clear plays available, lead a card from the unbid Spade suit.
PLDIS12: We do not have a winner in the Diamond suit, so discard low with the three.
PLDF47: Partner's DA can win the trick, so discard the D3.
PLDIS12: We do not have a winner in the Club suit, so discard low with the eight. 
PLDF36: Partner's four is high or we can't beat the highest card, so discard the C3.   <<<<<<<<< Gives North cheap trick
