Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
North bids 3C.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL3: But we lack the strength with 7.0 pts for a simple overcall.
B00: We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
South bids 4S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.
