Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 11.0, Distn pts = 4.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.0; Total pts = 11.0.
  QT's = 1.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, C

====================
North passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.

West bids 2D.
--------------------
North bids 3D.
--------------------
B00 Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Diamonds.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Diamond contract...
3REVAL6: Deducting 6 point(s) for the 3 trump(s) short of 4.
2REVAL70: Dummy's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 11.0 down to 8.5 points.
ROVRC5: Partner overcalled at the 2-level, indicating a good 5+ card Diamond suit, 9.5-14.5 points, and probably 6+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 18.0-23.0 points.
ROVRC20: And although we want to bid our own 6-card Club suit, we can't bid it at the 4 with only 11.0 points, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
South bids 3H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North bids 4H.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.
