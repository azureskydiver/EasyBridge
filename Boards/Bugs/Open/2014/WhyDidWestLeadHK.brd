Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 8.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.0; Total pts = 7.0.
  QT's = 0.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  3 Likely Winners (0/1/2/0)
  10 Likely Losers (3/1/3/3)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
South bids 1C.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL3: But we lack the strength with 7.0 pts for a simple overcall.
B00: We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North bids 3C.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Clubs.  Declarer is South; West leads.
=======================
PL02: Starting play as left-hand defender.
PLYLEAD: Making opening lead as West against a contract of 3 Clubs.
PLYLD4A: Lead the fourth card from our best suit (Diamonds) -- play the D3.
PLAYDF2: Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
PLDF2H1: Play second hand low with the two.
PLAYDF2: Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
PLDF2H2: As second hand, play the lowest card we have in the suit, the eight.
RCP5A: East is now known to have started with 2 Clubs.
PLYSIG20: Partner discarded high in the Spade suit, indicating a preference for that suit.
PLAYB41: Play the Jack to win the trick.
PLCSW9: With no other good options, cash a winner in the Diamond suit, the Queen
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Diamonds.
PLYSIG1: Partner discarded low with the four, so consider it a signal that he dislikes the suit.
PLYLDWN2: We'd like to lead the Diamonds suit, but dummy might ruff.
PLYLD43: With no good card to lead, lead the HK since dummy is not void in the Heart suit (we don't know about declarer, though).
PLYSIG1: Partner discarded low with the six, so consider it a signal that he dislikes the suit.
