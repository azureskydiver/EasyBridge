We have 9 sure tricks against a requirement of 9 for the 3NT contract.
The Diamond suit looks the most promising for further development.
Checking play sequencing...
Interleaving plays...
The tentative list of available plays is as follows:
------>
 Play 1: Opportunistically play the Jack from hand to finesse against South.
 Play 2: Cash the Ace of Clubs in dummy.
 Play 3: Play the SA from Dummy to try and drop the ST.
 Play 4: Cash the Ace of Spades in dummy.
 Play 5: Play the King of Diamonds from dummy to force out the opponents' Ace.
 Play 6: Play the King of Diamonds from dummy to force out the opponents' Nine.
 Play 7: Cash the Eight of Diamonds in hand.
 Play 8: Cash the Ten of Diamonds in dummy.
 Play 9: Cash the Jack of Diamonds in dummy.
 Play 10: Lead a low Diamond from hand and finesse the King in dummy against South.
 Play 11: Lead a low Diamond from dummy and finesse the Queen in hand against North.
 Play 12: Cash the Ace of Hearts in hand.
 Play 13: Cash the Ace of Spades in dummy.
 Play 14: Cash the King of Spades in dummy.
 Play 15: Cash the Queen of Spades in dummy.
 Play 16: Cash the Jack of Spades in dummy.
The planning is complete.
---------------------------
Sluff the S5 from dummy in second position to prep the HJ play.
The finesse worked; win with the HJ.
Reviewing play plan for round 2...
We have only 6 reasonably sure tricks left vs. 8 more trick(s) required for the contract.
The Diamond suit looks the most promising for further development.
Checking play sequencing...
We want to work on developing the Diamond suit first, so move its plays up to the front if possible.
Interleaving plays...
Cash the HA from hand.
Playing card from dummy.
Our cash of the HA from hand is holding, so discard the S7.
Playing card from dummy.
Our cash of the D2 from hand is not holding, so cover with the D7.   <<<<<<<<<<<<NO Higher Have KQJT9
