--------------------
B00 Responding to partner's  bid of 2 Diamonds.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Diamond contract...
4REVAL21: Adjusting by 1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 4-card Diamond trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Spades, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 9.0 to 11.0 points.
ROVRC5: Partner overcalled at the 2-level, indicating a good 5+ card Diamond suit, 9.5-14.5 points, and probably 6+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 20.5-25.5 points.
ROVRC99: We have insufficient strength for either a raise, suit shift, or NT bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 Spades.  Declarer is East; South leads.
=======================

PLDF48: We can't beat West's CK, so discard the C8.
PLAYDF2: Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
PLDF2H1: Play second hand low with the six.
PLAYDF2: Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
PLDF2A: Play our only card in the suit, the ten.
PLDF37: Partner's four might not win the round, so top it with the Ace.
PLYLD42: With no good card to lead, lead the DQ since the opponents have not shown out of the Diamond suit.  <<<<<<<<<<CLUB??
