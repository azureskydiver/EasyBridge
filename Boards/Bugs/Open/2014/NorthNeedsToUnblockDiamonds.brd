Planning the play...

  Probable Stoppers in:
  11 Sure Winners (0/2/3/6)
  10 Eventual Winners (0/2/3/5)
  3 Possible Losers (vs. 4 allowable)
We have 10 sure tricks against a requirement of 9 for the 3NT contract.
The Heart suit looks the most promising for further development.
Checking play sequencing...
Since we have enough cashing tricks (11) to fulfill the contract, we can just proceed with the cashing.
Interleaving plays...
The tentative list of available plays is as follows:
------>
 Play 1: Cash the Ace of Diamonds in hand.
 Play 2: Cash the Ace of Hearts in dummy.
 Play 3: Cash the Ten of Clubs in dummy.
 Play 4: Cash the Ace of Clubs in hand.
 Play 5: Cash the King of Clubs in hand.
 Play 6: Cash the Queen of Clubs in hand.
 Play 7: Cash the Jack of Clubs in hand.
 Play 8: Cash the Nine of Clubs in hand.
 Play 9: Cash the Ace of Diamonds in hand.
 Play 10: Cash the King of Diamonds in hand.
 Play 11: Cash the Queen of Diamonds in dummy.
 Play 12: Cash the Ace of Hearts in dummy.
 Play 13: Cash the King of Hearts in dummy.
 Play 14: Play the DA from hand to try and drop the DJ.
 Play 15: Lead a low Heart from hand to finesse the ten in dummy against West, with the { HA HK  } as possible cover cards.
 Play 16: Lead the Heart nine from hand and finesses it, with the { HA HK  } in dummy as possible cover cards.
 Play 17: Lead the Diamond ten from dummy and finesses it, with the { DA DK  } in hand as possible cover cards.
 Play 18: Cash the King of Spades in hand.
The planning is complete.
---------------------------
No usable plays found for the current situation.
Playing second in dummy, using default player logic.
We don't have a winner in the suit in dummy, so discard the eight.

No usable plays found for the current situation.
Play the King to win the trick.
Reviewing play plan for round 2...
We have 11 reasonably sure tricks left vs. 8 more trick(s) required for the contract.
The Heart suit looks the most promising for further development.
Checking play sequencing...
Since we have enough cashing tricks (10) to fulfill the contract, we can just proceed with the cashing.
Interleaving plays...
Lead a low Heart (the seven) from hand in order to cash the Ace in dummy.
