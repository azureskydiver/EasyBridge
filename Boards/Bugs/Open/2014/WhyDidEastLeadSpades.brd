Partner has passed, so we pass also.
We pass.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 5 Diamonds.  Declarer is South; West leads.
=======================
Starting play as right-hand defender.
Since we can win the next round of Spades, we want to signal by discarding high in the suit.
Begin the high-low signal with the seven.
Partner's SA can win the trick, so discard the S7.
South is now known to have started with 0 Spades.
West is now known to have started with 0 Diamonds.
Play the Ace to win the trick.
We'd like to lead the Spades suit, but declarer might ruff.   <<<<<<<<<<<<<YES
Return partner's openning lead by leading the SK.    <<<<<<<<<<<????
