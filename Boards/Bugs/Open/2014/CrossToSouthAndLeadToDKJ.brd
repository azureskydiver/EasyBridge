PLN10: We have only 7 sure tricks against a requirement of 10 for the 4D contract.
PLNPRI: The Spade suit looks the most promising for further development.
PLSEQ: Checking play sequencing...
PLSEQ6: We want to work on developing the Spade suit first, so move its plays up to the front if possible.
PINTLV: Interleaving plays...
PLN90: The tentative list of available plays is as follows:
------>
 Play 1: Lead a low Spade from hand to finesse the Queen in dummy against West, with the Ace as cover.
 Play 2: Lead the Spade ten from hand and finesse it, with the Ace in dummy as cover.
 Play 3: Cash the Ace of Spades in dummy.
 Play 4: Ruff a Heart in hand.
 Play 5: Lead the Heart Queen from dummy and finesse it, with the Ace in hand as cover.
 Play 6: Lead a low Heart from hand and finesse the Queen in dummy against West.
 Play 7: Cash the Ace of Hearts in hand.
 Play 8: Cash the Ace of Clubs in dummy.
 Play 9: Cash the King of Clubs in dummy.
 Play 10: Cash the Queen of Clubs in dummy.
 Play 11: Cash the Jack of Clubs in hand.
PLN95: The planning is complete.
---------------------------
PL2FN30: LHO has led the H7, which is the same suit as our HQ finesse card and lower in value, so we can still try the finesse.
PL2FN22: Play the finesse card (the Queen) from dummy.
