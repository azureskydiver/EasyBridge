We have only 11 sure tricks against a requirement of 12 for the 6S contract.
The Diamond suit looks the most promising for further development.
Checking play sequencing...
We want to work on developing the Diamond suit first, so move its plays up to the front if possible.
Interleaving plays...
The tentative list of available plays is as follows:
------>
 Play 1: Pull a round of trumps with the King in hand.
 Play 2: Pull a round of trumps with the Queen in hand.
 Play 3: Pull a round of trumps with the Ace in hand if necessary.
 Play 4: Ruff a Diamond in hand.
 Play 5: Cash the Ace of Diamonds in hand.
 Play 6: Ruff a Club in hand.
 Play 7: Play the King of Clubs from dummy to force out the opponents' Ace.
 Play 8: Cash the Ace of Hearts in dummy.
 Play 9: Cash the King of Spades in dummy.
 Play 10: Cash the Queen of Spades in dummy.
 Play 11: Cash the Nine of Spades in dummy.
 Play 12: Cash the Ten of Spades in hand.
 Play 13: Cash the Ace of Spades in hand.
 Play 14: Cash the Eight of Spades in hand.
The planning is complete.
