We have only 5 sure tricks against a requirement of 9 for the 3S contract.
The Club suit looks the most promising for further development.
Checking play sequencing...
Interleaving plays...
The tentative list of available plays is as follows:
------>
 Play 1: Opportunistically play the King from dummy to finesse against West.
 Play 2: Pull a round of trumps with the Queen in dummy.
 Play 3: Ruff a Club in hand.
 Play 4: Ruff a Heart in hand.
 Play 5: Ruff a Heart in hand.
 Play 6: Ruff a Diamond in hand.
 Play 7: Lead a low Club from hand to finesse the Jack in dummy against East, with the Ace as cover.
 Play 8: Lead a low Heart from dummy and finesse the Queen in hand against West.
 Play 9: Lead a low Heart from dummy and finesse the King in hand against West.
 Play 10: Lead a low Diamond from hand and finesse the King in dummy against East.
 Play 11: Play the King of Hearts from hand to force out the opponents' Ace.
 Play 12: Play the King of Hearts from hand to force out the opponents' Seven.
 Play 13: Cash the King of Clubs in hand.
 Play 14: Cash the Ace of Clubs in dummy.
The planning is complete.
---------------------------
Opportunistically finesse the DK from dummy in second position against East.  <<<<<<< ????
