--------------------
West bids 2D.
--------------------

--------------------
B00 Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Diamonds.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Diamond contract...
3REVAL6: Deducting 6 point(s) for the 3 trump(s) short of 4.
2REVAL70: Dummy's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 12.0 down to 10.5 points.
ROVRC5: Partner overcalled at the 2-level, indicating a good 5+ card Diamond suit, 9.5-14.5 points, and probably 6+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 20.0-25.0 points.
BN1: With 21.5-26.5 HCPs in the partnership and a reasonably balanced hand, and all suits stopped, bid 2 No Trump.
We bid 2NT.
