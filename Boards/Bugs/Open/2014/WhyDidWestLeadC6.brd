[[File Comments]]
Why does West play C6 vs SA (in auto play)?
>>>>>>>>>WEST<<<<<<<
Starting play as left-hand defender.
Making opening lead as West against a contract of 4 Hearts.
Lead the fourth card from our best suit (Diamonds) -- play the D2.
Partner discarded low with the five, so consider it a signal that he dislikes the suit.
We can't beat South's King, so discard the H2.
Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
Play second hand low with the two.
Playing third ahead of dummy, we need to beat dummy's ten, so play the Queen.
With no other good options, cash a winner in the Spade suit, the Ace
With no good card to lead, lead the C6 since the opponents have not shown out of the Club suit.  <<<<<????
