North when trumped should force the K in dummy. Playing the 4H is silly.

The best suit is Spades.
====================
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 1S.
--------------------
South bids 2C.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
B00 Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Clubs.
Partner overcalled at the 2-level, indicating a good 5+ card Club suit, 9.5-14.5 points, and probably 6+ playing tricks.
The total point count in the partnership is therefore 10.5-15.5 points.
This is not enough to bid any higher, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East doubles.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 2H.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 Hearts.  Declarer is West; North leads.
=======================
Starting play as left-hand defender.
Making opening lead as North against a contract of 2 Hearts.
Lead the singleton C6.
Although we could trump this hand, partner's CK is high, so discard the S2.
North is now known to have started with 1 Club.
Dummy is now out of Clubs.
With no cards in Clubs, trump with the H4.<<<<<=================Should trump with at least 6 to force KH<<******

====================
PLDF55: With no cards in Clubs, trump with the H4.  <<< debug version
