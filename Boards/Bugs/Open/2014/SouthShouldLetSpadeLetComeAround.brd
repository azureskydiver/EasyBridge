  Stoppers in: S, H, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  6 Sure Winners (2/2/0/2)
  8 Eventual Winners (4/2/0/2)
  5 Possible Losers (vs. 3 allowable)
PLDM: Playing card from dummy.
PLNADJ: Reviewing play plan for round 2...
DEBUG1: NumMaxWinners=10 vs SureTricks=6 vs NumWinners=10, m_numTricksShort=4
PLRV10: We have only 6 reasonably sure tricks left vs. 10 more trick(s) required for the contract.
PLNPRI: The Heart suit looks the most promising for further development.
PLSEQ: Checking play sequencing...
PLSEQ6: We want to work on developing the Heart suit first, so move its plays up to the front if possible.
PINTLV: Interleaving plays...
PL2FN30: LHO has led the S4, which is the same suit as our SJ finesse card and lower in value, so we can still try the finesse.
PLCSH55: The opponents led a Spade, so cash the Ace now.  <<<<<<<<<<<<NO Free finesse
