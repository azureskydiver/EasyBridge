We have only 7 sure tricks against a requirement of 9 for the 3NT contract.
The Spade suit looks the most promising for further development.
Checking play sequencing...
We want to work on developing the Spade suit first, so move its plays up to the front if possible.
Interleaving plays...
The tentative list of available plays is as follows:
------>
 Play 1: Cash the Ace of Spades in hand.
 Play 2: Lead a low Spade from dummy to finesse the Queen in hand against West, with the Ace as cover.
 Play 3: Cash the Ace of Spades in hand.
 Play 4: Lead the Club Jack from hand and finesse it, with the Ace in dummy as cover.
 Play 5: Cash the Ace of Clubs in dummy.
 Play 6: Cash the King of Diamonds in dummy.
 Play 7: Cash the Ace of Diamonds in hand.
 Play 8: Cash the Ace of Hearts in hand.
 Play 9: Cash the King of Hearts in dummy.
 Play 10: Cash the Queen of Hearts in hand.
The planning is complete.
---------------------------
The opponents led a Diamond, so cash the King now.

Our cash of the DK from dummy is holding, so discard the D4.
