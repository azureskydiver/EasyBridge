====================
West bids 1D.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL3: But we lack the strength with 1.0 pts for a simple overcall.
B00: We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 1H.
--------------------
South bids 2C.
--------------------
West bids 2H.
--------------------
B00 Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Clubs.
ROVRC5: Partner overcalled at the 2-level, indicating a good 5+ card Club suit, 9.5-14.5 points, and probably 6+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 10.5-15.5 points.
ROVRC10: This is not enough to bid any higher, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 4H.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 4 Hearts.  Declarer is East; South leads.
