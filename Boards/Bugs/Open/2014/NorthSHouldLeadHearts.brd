PLYLEAD: Making opening lead as North against a contract of 3 Spades.
PLYLD15: Lead the HK from the top of the { HA HK } sequence.
PLCSW9: With no other good options, cash a winner in the Heart suit, the Ace
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Hearts.
PLYSIG6: Partner discarded low with the eight after discarding the nine last round, thus marking a high-low suit preference signal.
PLYLDPRF1: Partner likes the Heart suit, but dummy can ruff, so skip this suit for now.  <<<<<<<<<South could overruff
PLYLD42: With no good card to lead, lead the D8 since the opponents have not shown out of the Diamond suit.
