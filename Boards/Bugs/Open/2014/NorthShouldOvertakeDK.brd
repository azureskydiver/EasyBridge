Dummy's hand has been laid down; now planning the play with a contract of 3 Spades.
---------------------------
Planning the play...

  C:T97643 (73/T964)
Combined hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 22.0, Distn pts = 7.0;   Total pts = 29.0.

  Stoppers in: S, H, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  7 Sure Winners (4/0/3/0)
  9 Eventual Winners (6/0/3/0)
  4 Possible Losers (vs. 4 allowable)
We have 9 sure tricks against a requirement of 9 for the 3S contract.
The Diamond suit looks the most promising for further development.
Checking play sequencing...
We can fulfill the contract by pulling 4 round(s) of trumps, and cashing the DA, DK, DQ, S9 and S8.
Interleaving plays...
The tentative list of available plays is as follows:
------>
 Play 1: Pull a round of trumps with the King in hand.
 Play 2: Pull a round of trumps with the Ace in hand.
 Play 3: Pull a round of trumps with the Queen in hand if necessary.
 Play 4: Pull a round of trumps with the Jack in hand if necessary.
 Play 5: Ruff a Diamond in hand.
 Play 6: Ruff a Diamond in hand.
 Play 7: Ruff a Heart in hand.
 Play 8: Ruff a Club in dummy.
 Play 9: Ruff a Club in dummy.
 Play 10: Cash the King of Diamonds in hand.
 Play 11: Cash the Ace of Diamonds in dummy.
 Play 12: Cash the Queen of Diamonds in dummy.
 Play 13: Cash the King of Spades in dummy.
 Play 14: Cash the Ace of Spades in hand.
 Play 15: Cash the Queen of Spades in hand.
 Play 16: Cash the Jack of Spades in hand.
 Play 17: Cash the Nine of Spades in hand.
 Play 18: Cash the Eight of Spades in hand.
 Play 19: Play the DK from hand to try and drop the DJ.
 Play 20: Lead a low Heart from hand and finesse the King in dummy against East.
The planning is complete.
