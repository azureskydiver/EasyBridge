  HCPs = 8.0, Distn pts = 3.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.5;
Total pts = 7.5.
  QT's = 1.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  4 Likely Winners (0/0/0/4)
  9 Likely Losers (3/3/1/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Have a strong suit in Clubs.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
North passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
South bids 1NT.
--------------------
West bids 2H.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
B00 Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Hearts.
Adjusting by -1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
Partner overcalled at the 2-level, indicating a good 5+ card Heart suit, 9.5-14.5 points, and probably 6+ playing tricks.
The total point count in the partnership is therefore 17.0-22.0 points.
This is insufficient to raise partner, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
South bids 3D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.

Bidding finished; contract is 3 Diamonds.  Declarer is South; West leads.
=======================
Starting play as right-hand defender.
Play high with the Queen.

With no cards in the suit led and no trumps, we discard the C9.
East is now known to have started with 1 Diamond.
Dummy is now out of Diamonds.
Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
Indicate a preference for the Club by discarding high with the C8.
We have no Diamonds and no trumps, so discard the C8.
Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
As second hand, play the lowest card we have in the suit, the three.
We do not have a winner in the Heart suit, so discard low with the four.
Partner's HA can win the trick, so discard the H4.
South is now known to have started with 1 Heart.
West is now known to have started with 1 Club.
Play the King to win the trick.
Partner is void in Clubs and may still have some trumps, so lead the C3.
Dummy is now out of Clubs.
