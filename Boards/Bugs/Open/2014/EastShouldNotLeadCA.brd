[[File Comments]]
East should not lead CA - sets up dummy's clubs
>>>>EAST<<<<<<
PL03: Starting play as right-hand defender.
PLDIS12: We do not have a winner in the Heart suit, so discard low with the three.
PLDF48: We can't beat North's HK, so discard the H3.
PLAYDF2: Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
PLDF2G3: We can beat top outstanding card and still guard dummy so play King.
PLCSW9: With no other good options, cash a winner in the Club suit, the Ace
PLYLD84: With no other obvious plays, cash a winner with the CA.  <<<<<<<<<<<<NO
