We have 11 sure tricks against a requirement of 10 for the 4NT contract.
The Spade suit looks the most promising for further development.
Checking play sequencing...
Interleaving plays...
The tentative list of available plays is as follows:
------>
 Play 1: Opportunistically play the Jack from hand to finesse against East.
 Play 2: Play the DA from Dummy to try and drop the DJ.
 Play 3: Play the Queen of Spades from hand to force out the opponents' King.
 Play 4: Cash the Nine of Spades in hand.
 Play 5: Cash the Ten of Spades in dummy.
 Play 6: Cash the Jack of Spades in dummy.
 Play 7: Lead a low Club from dummy to finesse the Jack in dummy against West, with the { CA CK  } as possible cover cards.
 Play 8: Lead a low Spade from hand to finesse the ten in dummy against East, with the Ace as cover.
 Play 9: Lead a low Spade from hand to finesse the Jack in dummy against East, with the Ace as cover.
 Play 10: Lead the Spade Queen from hand and finesse it, with the Ace in dummy as cover.
 Play 11: Lead a low Heart from hand to finesse the Jack in dummy against East, with the King as cover.
 Play 12: Lead a low Diamond from hand to finesse the ten in dummy against East, with the Ace as cover.

Sluff the C2 from dummy in second position to prep the CJ play.
Combined hand (Dummy/Hand):
  S:AQJT98653 (AJT53/Q986)
  H:AKJ72 (KJ7/A2)
  D:AKQT942 (AQT/K942)

  Probable Stoppers in:
  8 Sure Winners (1/2/3/2)
  11 Eventual Winners (4/2/3/2)
  2 Possible Losers (vs. 3 allowable)
The finesse worked; win with the CJ.
Reviewing play plan for round 2...
We have only 8 reasonably sure tricks left vs. 9 more trick(s) required for the contract.
The Spade suit looks the most promising for further development.
Checking play sequencing...
We want to work on developing the Spade suit first, so move its plays up to the front if possible.
Interleaving plays...
Play the SQ from hand to force out the opponents' King.
Playing card from dummy.
We're in the opposite hand of a force play, so discard the S3.  //<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< NO Have AJT98 for draw
