Why did West lead SK (Spades are trump)
>>>>>>>>>>>WEST<<<<<<<<<<
S:K96  H:J93  D:A95  C:QT95
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 10.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-0.5; Total pts = 9.5.
  QT's = 1.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  1 Likely Winners (0/0/0/1)
  12 Likely Losers (3/3/3/3)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
North bids 1S.
--------------------
East bids 2H.
--------------------
South bids 2S.
--------------------
B00 Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Hearts.
Adjusting by 1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Heart trump support including a trump honor, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 9.5 to 11.0 points.
Partner overcalled at the 2-level, indicating a good 5+ card Heart suit, 9.5-14.5 points, and probably 6+ playing tricks.
The total point count in the partnership is therefore 20.5-25.5 points.
We have insufficient strength for either a raise, suit shift, or NT bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North bids 3S.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Spades.  Declarer is North; East leads.
=======================
Starting play as right-hand defender.
Partner's seven is high or we can't beat the highest card, so discard the S6.
Play the Ace to win the trick.
Return partner's openning lead by leading the SK.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<????
East is now known to have started with 1 Spade.
Dummy is now out of Spades.
