We have only 5 sure tricks against a requirement of 9 for the 3NT contract.
The Club suit looks the most promising for further development.
Checking play sequencing...

 Play 3: Hold up a round of Spades.
 Play 4: Play the Ace of Clubs from hand to force out the opponents' King.
 Play 5: Play the Ace of Clubs from hand to force out the opponents' Ten.

 Play 7: Lead the Club Queen from dummy and finesse it, with the Ace in hand as cover.
 Play 8: Lead a low Club from hand and finesse the Queen in dummy against West.
