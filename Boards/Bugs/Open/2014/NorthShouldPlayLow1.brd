PLN10: We have only 7 sure tricks against a requirement of 9 for the 3NT contract.
PLNPRI: The Heart suit looks the most promising for further development.
PLSEQ: Checking play sequencing...
PLSEQ6: We want to work on developing the Heart suit first, so move its plays up to the front if possible.
PINTLV: Interleaving plays...
PLN90: The tentative list of available plays is as follows:
------>
 Play 1: Lead a low Heart from hand and finesse the King in dummy against East.
 Play 2: Lead a low Heart from dummy and finesse the Queen in hand against West.
 Play 3: Cash the Ace of Clubs in dummy.
 Play 4: Cash the King of Clubs in hand.
 Play 5: Cash the Queen of Clubs in hand.
PLN95: The planning is complete.
---------------------------
PLCSH55: The opponents led a Club, so cash the Ace now.
