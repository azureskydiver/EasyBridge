====================
West passes.

Opening bid for team.
E02: Have 13.0 points in high cards and 2.5 quick tricks, so bid 1 Diamond.
We bid 1D.
--------------------
South bids 1S.
--------------------
West doubles.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Diamond and partner's response of Double.
NEGDR2: Partner has bid a negative double, indicating 4+ cards in the unbid majors (Hearts).
NEGDR8: Partner's negative double indicates 5.5-18.5 points, for a total in the partnership of 18.5-31.5 points.
NEGDTR30: With 18.5 pts in the partnership and 3 cards available in Hearts, bid 2 Hearts.
We bid 2H.

--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 2 Hearts and partner's response of 3 Hearts.
RDR0: With a single raise, partner is showing 6.0-18.5 points and decent (3-4 card) support for our Heart suit.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer for Heart contract...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 5.
3REVAL8: Since the trump suit is only topped by a five, deduct 8 points.
2REVAL18: Declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract in Hearts from 13.0 down to 1.0 points)
RDR2b: We have a total of 7.0-19.5 points in the partnership, which is not enough for game, so settle for a part score and pass.
We pass.

Bidding finished; contract is 3 Hearts.  Declarer is East; South leads.
