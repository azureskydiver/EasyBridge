Planning the play...
Combined hand (Dummy/Hand):
  S:AKT986 (T6/AK98)
  H:AKQ9765 (A97/KQ65)

We have only 8 sure tricks against a requirement of 9 for the 3NT contract.
The Club suit looks the most promising for further development.
Checking play sequencing...
We want to work on developing the Club suit first, so move its plays up to the front if possible.
Interleaving plays...
The tentative list of available plays is as follows:
------>
 Play 1: Play the Queen of Clubs from dummy to force out the opponents' Ace.
 Play 2: Play the Queen of Clubs from dummy to force out the opponents' King.
 Play 3: Play the Queen of Clubs from dummy to force out the opponents' Five.
 Play 4: Play the Queen of Clubs from dummy to force out the opponents' Four.
 Play 5: Cash the Eight of Clubs in dummy.
 Play 6: Lead a low Club from dummy and finesse the Jack in hand against East.
 Play 7: Play the HA from Dummy to try and drop one or more of the { HJ HT  }.
 Play 8: Play the HK from hand to try and drop one or more of the { HJ HT  }.
 Play 9: Cash the Ace of Spades in hand.
 Play 10: Cash the King of Spades in hand.
 Play 11: Cash the Ace of Hearts in dummy.
 Play 12: Cash the King of Hearts in hand.
 Play 13: Cash the Queen of Hearts in hand.
 Play 14: Cash the Queen of Diamonds in hand.
 Play 15: Cash the Ace of Diamonds in dummy.
The planning is complete.
---------------------------
The opponents led a Diamond, so cash the Ace now.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<NO unblocks Diamonds
