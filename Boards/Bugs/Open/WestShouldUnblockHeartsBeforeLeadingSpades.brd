PLN10: We have only 8 sure tricks against a requirement of 9 for the 3S contract.
PLNPRI: The Heart suit looks the most promising for further development.
PLSEQ: Checking play sequencing...
PINTLV: Interleaving plays...
PLN90: The tentative list of available plays is as follows:
------>
 Play 1: Opportunistically play the nine from dummy to finesse against North.
 Play 2: Ruff a Heart in hand.
 Play 3: Ruff a Heart in hand.
 Play 4: Ruff a Heart in hand.
 Play 5: Ruff a Diamond in dummy.
 Play 6: Ruff a Club in hand.
 Play 7: Ruff a Club in hand.

 Play 14: Cash the King of Spades in hand.
 Play 15: Cash the Queen of Spades in dummy.
 Play 16: Cash the Jack of Spades in hand.
PLN95: The planning is complete.
---------------------------
PLAFN54: Opportunistically finesse the D9 from dummy in second position against South.
PLAFN77: The finesse failed, so abandon the play
PLYTRY: No usable plays found for the current situation.
PLYE41: Play the Ace to win the trick.
PLNADJ: Reviewing play plan for round 2...
PLRV10: We have only 7 reasonably sure tricks left vs. 8 more trick(s) required for the contract.
PLSEQ: Checking play sequencing...
PLSEQ20: We can fulfill the contract by pulling 5 round(s) of trumps, and cashing the HA, HK, HQ, HT, H9 and S6.
PINTLV: Interleaving plays...
PLTRMP12: Lead out the S3 from hand to pull in a round of trumps.
PLDM: Playing card from dummy.
PLTRMP82b: Since LHO may hold the trump ten, we have to play the Queen from dummy.
