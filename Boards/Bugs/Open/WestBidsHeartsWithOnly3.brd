West  overcalls in Hearts with only 3???
>>>>>>>> WEST <<<<<<<<
S:A5  H:Q86  D:653  C:QJ952
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 9.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 9.0.
  QT's = 1.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Likely Winners (1/1/0/3)
  8 Likely Losers (1/2/3/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
Opening bid for team.
Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 1C.
--------------------
South bids 1D.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Club.
REVAL38: (with 5-card Club trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Spades, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 9.0 to 14.0 points)
F01: Partner, opening in third position, is showing 10.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
I08: Have 9.0/9.0/14.0 points with 5-card support for partner's Clubs (holding QJ952), which is too strong for a limit raise, so we have to temporarily shift to Hearts with a bid of 1 Heart. <<<<<?????????
We bid 1H.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 2H.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Club, 1 Heart, and 2 Hearts.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 5.
3REVAL8: Since the trump suit is only topped by a Ace, deduct 1 points.
2REVAL18: Declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 9.0 down to 4.0 points)
B4H11: Partner made a single raise of our Heart suit, showing 12.0-20.0 points with 3+ trump cards.
B4H18: With only 9.0/9.0/4.0 pts in hand, for a total in the partnership of 14.0-24.0 points, a game is unlikely, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 Hearts.  Declarer is West; North leads.
