====================
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 1H.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL3: But we lack the strength for a simple overcall.

We pass.
--------------------
East bids 2C.
--------------------
South bids 2D.
--------------------
West bids 2NT.
--------------------
Responding to partner's  bid of 2 Diamonds.
REVAL38: (with 3-card Diamond trump support & a singleton in Hearts, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 7.0 to 9.0 points)
ROVRC5: Partner overcalled at the 2-level, indicating a good 5+ card Diamond suit, 9.0-14.0 points, and probably 6+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 18.0-23.0 points.
ROVRC99: We have insufficient strength for either a raise, suit shift, or NT bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 3NT.
--------------------
South passes.
