>>>>>>>>>> NORTH <<<<<<<<<<<<
S:Q64  H:Q92  D:AJ863  C:A8
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 13.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 13.0.
  QT's = 2.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  6 Likely Winners (1/1/3/1)
  7 Likely Losers (2/2/2/1)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
Opening bid for team.
E01: Have 13.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Diamond.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Diamond and partner's response of 1 Spade.
B3U00: Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid, Spades over Diamonds, which shows 5.0-17.0 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL38: (with 3-card Spade trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Clubs, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 13.0 to 15.0 points)
B3U14: With decent 3-card support for partner's major Spade suit (holding Q64), no rebiddable suit, and no openable second suit, raise to 2 Spades.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
BXL05: Partner has bid yet another suit, Hearts.
BXL30: Although partner bid Hearts, we prefer to return to his previous Spade suit. ???????????????
BXL38: Support partner's Spade suit with 3-card support and 20.0-32.0 total team pts by bidding 3 Spades.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 4S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 4.
BXM81: We've reached agreement in suits, but with only 20.0-32.0 total points we can't raise partner's 4 Spades bid any further, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 4 Spades.  Declarer is South; West leads.
