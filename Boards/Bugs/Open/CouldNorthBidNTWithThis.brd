North raised South's 2S vs bidding NT ???
>>>>>>NORTH<<<<<<<<
S:97  H:AQ9  D:QJT  C:AQJT9
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 16.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 16.0.
  QT's = 3.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  7 Likely Winners (0/2/1/4)
  6 Likely Losers (2/1/2/1)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Spades.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL7: Adding 1 point(s) for the solid Club suit.
3REVAL6: Deducting 1 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
RWKT: Partner made a weak 2-bid, showing a a 6+ card suit with 5.0-10.0 points, less than 4 cards in the other major, no voids, and no more than one singleton.
We have 16.0/16.0/16.0 points, for a partnership total of 21.0-26.0 points, so we are interested in game if a good fit can be found.
RWKT30: We lack good support for partner's Spade (holding 97), but our hand is not appropriate for NT and we have no good suit of our own, so the best we can do is raise partner to 3 Spades.  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> ??? NT looks better ???
We bid 3S.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Spades.  Declarer is South; West leads.
