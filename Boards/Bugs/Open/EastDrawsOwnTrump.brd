Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 12.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;

Playing five-card majors, Hearts can be opened.
Have a strong suit in Hearts.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
E02: Have 12.0 points in high cards and 3.0 quick tricks, so bid 1 Heart.
--------------------
South bids 2D.
--------------------
West bids 3D.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Heart and partner's response of 3 Diamonds.
B3Y00: Partner has made a jump shift to 3 Diamonds after our opening 1 Heart bid, which indicates 18.0+ points and is forcing to game (and points to a possible slam).
B3Y22: With a rebiddable Hearts suit and poor support for partner's Diamonds (holding 3), rebid our suit at 3 Hearts.
--------------------
South bids 4D.
--------------------
West bids 4H.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
BXB30: Partner has bid game in the Heart suit, and with only 30.0-31.0 pts in the partnership, we don't want to raise further, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 4 Hearts.  Declarer is East; South leads.
