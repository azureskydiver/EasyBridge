PLN10: We have only 6 sure tricks against a requirement of 8 for the 2S contract.
PLNPRI: The Club suit looks the most promising for further development.
PLSEQ: Checking play sequencing...
PLSEQ6: We want to work on developing the Club suit first, so move its plays up to the front if possible.
PINTLV: Interleaving plays...
PLN90: The tentative list of available plays is as follows:
------>
 Play 1: Pull a round of trumps with the King in hand.
 Play 2: Pull a round of trumps with the Ace in hand.
 Play 3: Ruff a Club in hand.
 Play 4: Ruff a Club in hand.
 Play 5: Ruff a Club in hand.
 Play 6: Lead a low Club from hand and finesse the Queen in dummy against South.
 Play 7: Ruff a Heart in dummy.
 Play 8: Lead a low Heart from dummy and finesse the Queen in hand against North.
 Play 9: Cash the Ace of Diamonds in hand.
 Play 10: Cash the King of Diamonds in dummy.
 Play 11: Cash the Queen of Diamonds in hand.
 Play 12: Cash the Jack of Diamonds in dummy.
 Play 13: Cash the Ace of Spades in hand.
 Play 14: Cash the King of Spades in hand.
PLN95: The planning is complete.
---------------------------
PL3FN36: Play low Heart (the three) from dummy to opportunistically finesse the Queen in hand.
PL3FN92: RHO has played a higher card (the King) than our intended finesse (the Queen), so skip the play.
PLYTRY: No usable plays found for the current situation.
PLYE48: We can't beat South's King, so discard the H8.
PLNADJ: Reviewing play plan for round 2...
PLRV10: We have only 6 reasonably sure tricks left vs. 8 more trick(s) required for the contract.
PLSEQ: Checking play sequencing...
PLSEQ20: We can fulfill the contract by pulling 3 round(s) of trumps, and cashing the CQ, DA, DK, DQ, DJ and HQ.
PINTLV: Interleaving plays...
PLCSH55: The opponents led a Diamond, so cash the Ace now.
PLDM: Playing card from dummy.
PLCSH80: the opponents led a Diamond, so see if we can finish up the cash play here.
PLCSH92b: Our cash of the DA from hand is holding, so discard the D4.
PLNADJ: Reviewing play plan for round 3...
PLRV10: We have only 5 reasonably sure tricks left vs. 7 more trick(s) required for the contract.
PLSEQ: Checking play sequencing...
PLSEQ20: We can fulfill the contract by pulling 3 round(s) of trumps, and cashing the CQ, DK, DQ, DJ and HQ.
PINTLV: Interleaving plays...
PLTRMP18: Lead the S4 up to dummy to pull in a round of trumps.
PLDM: Playing card from dummy.
PLTRMP82c: although LHO may hold the trump Queen, we have nothing to beat it, so hope partner's four wins and discard the three. <<< FORCE ???
