West says too many pts for limit raise ???
>>>>>>> WEST <<<<<<<<<
S:K632  H:A5  D:T9652  C:QJ
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 10.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 10.0.
  QT's = 1.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H
  Probable Stoppers in:
  4 Likely Winners (2/1/1/0)
  9 Likely Losers (2/1/4/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suits are  Diamonds, Spades
The best suit is Diamonds.
====================
Opening bid for team.
Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 1D.
--------------------
South bids 1S.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Diamond.
REVAL38: (with 5-card Diamond trump support & doubletons in Clubs and Hearts, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 10.0 to 15.0 points)
F01: Partner, opening in third position, is showing 10.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
I08: Have 10.0/10.0/15.0 points with 5-card support for partner's Diamonds (holding T9652), which is too strong for a limit raise, so we have to temporarily shift to Spades with a bid of 2 Spades.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 3S.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Diamond, 2 Spades, and 3 Spades.
B4H00: Though partner raised our Spade suit after our jump shift, we really want to play in partner's Diamond suit.
B4H04: Now with 20.0-30.0 pts in the partnership, raise partner to game at a bid of 5 Diamonds.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 5 Diamonds.  Declarer is East; South leads.
