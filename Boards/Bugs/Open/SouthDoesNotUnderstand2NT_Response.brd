Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Spades.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Spade trump support & a void in Hearts, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 10.0 to 13.0 points)
RWKT: Partner made a weak 2-bid, showing a a 6+ card suit with 5.0-10.0 points, less than 4 cards in the other major, no voids, and no more than one singleton.
We have 10.0/10.0/13.0 points, for a partnership total of 18.0-23.0 points, so we are interested in game if a good fit can be found.
RWKT21: And we like partner's Spade suit (holding 964 support), but with only 18.0-23.0 total pts we don't quite have enough for a direct game bid, so invite partner to show an outside Ace or King with a bid of 2NT.
We bid 2NT.
