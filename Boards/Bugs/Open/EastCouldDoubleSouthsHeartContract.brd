East should do Penalty double of South's 3Heart bid
>>>>>>>> EAST <<<<<<<<<
S:AJ6  H:JT98654  D:A42  C:KT872
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 10.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 10.0.
  QT's = 2.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  6 Likely Winners (1/4/1/0)
  7 Likely Losers (2/3/2/0)
Playing five-card majors, Hearts can be opened.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
Opening bid for team.
Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.   <<<<<<<<<<<<< 
We pass.
--------------------
South bids 1H.
--------------------
West bids 2S.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Spades.
REVAL38: (with 3-card Spade trump support including a trump honor & a void in Clubs, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 10.0 to 14.0 points)
ROVRC3: Partner made a weak jump overcall of 2 Spades, indicating 5.5-9.5 pts and a good 6+ card Spade suit.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 19.5-23.5 points.
ROVRC99: We have insufficient strength for either a raise, suit shift, or NT bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
South bids 3H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.   <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< DOUBLE???????????
We pass.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Hearts.  Declarer is South; West leads.
