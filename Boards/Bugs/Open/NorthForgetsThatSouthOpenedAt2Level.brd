====================
South bids 2H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Hearts.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
RWKT: Partner made a weak 2-bid, showing a a 6+ card suit with 5.0-10.0 points, less than 4 cards in the other major, no voids, and no more than one singleton.  <<<<<<< NOTE!!!!
RWKT40: We have 20.0/20.0/20.0 points, for a partnership total of 25.0-30.0 points, so we may be interested in a possible slam.
RWKT48: We don't have very good support for partner's Heart suit (holding 8, and don't have the proper distribution for a NT response, so jump shift to 3 Spades.  Slam possibilities may be explored later.
We bid 3S.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3NT.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 2 Hearts, 3 Spades, and 3 No Trump.
NT50: Partner's shift from our 3 Spades bid to 3 No Trump indicates a balanced hand and 12.0+ points, for a total of 32.0+ points in the partnership.  <<<<<<< See NOTE above ????
B4G50: With 32.0+ total partnership points, bid a small slam.
BN1: With 32.0+ HCPs in the partnership and a reasonably balanced hand, though without stoppers in all suits, bid 6 No Trump.
We bid 6NT.
