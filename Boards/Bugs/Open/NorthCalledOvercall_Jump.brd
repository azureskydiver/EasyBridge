>>>> NORTH <<<<
S:KT52  H:42  D:63  C:Q8642
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 5.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.0;
Total pts = 4.0.
  QT's = 0.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Likely Winners (2/0/0/3)
  8 Likely Losers (2/2/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suits are  Clubs, Spades
The best suit is Clubs.
====================
South bids 1C.
--------------------
West bids 2NT.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Club.
REVAL38: (with 5-card Club trump support including a trump honor & doubletons in Diamonds and Hearts, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 4.0 to 11.0 points)
F00: Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
F04: But we have only 5.0/4.0/11.0 points against a minor suit bid, so we prefer to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 3D.
--------------------
South bids 4C.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Club, Pass, and 4 Clubs.
B4D0: Partner made a jump rebid of his Club suit to 4 Clubs, showing 17.0-19.0 points. <<<< NO Only  overcall<<<<
B4D20: With 5.0/4.0/11.0 pts in hand, for a total in the partnership of 28.0-30.0 pts, we have the points to make game or possibly slam, but so far with no agreed on suit.
YR4: Rebid the next best suit of Spades in a bid of 4 Spades.
B4D68: We have 5.0/4.0 pts in hand but no good fit with partner and no rebiddable suit, so we have no choice but to shift to yet another suit.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 4 Spades.  Declarer is North; East leads.
