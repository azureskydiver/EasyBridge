>>>>>>> NORTH<<<<<<
S:AKJ5  H:J64  D:JT8  C:J82
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 11.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.0;
Total pts = 10.0.
  QT's = 2.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S
  Probable Stoppers in:
  3 Likely Winners (3/0/0/0)
  10 Likely Losers (1/3/3/3)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Spades.
====================
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
E07: Have 11.0 points in high cards in 3rd position and a weak Diamond suit, so bid 1 Diamond.
We bid 1D.
--------------------
East doubles.
--------------------
South bids 2C.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Diamond and partner's response of 2 Clubs.
B3W00a: Partner has made a 2 over 1 bid following an earlier pass, Clubs over Diamonds, which shows 9.5-11.5 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL38: (with 3-card Club trump support including a trump honor, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 10.0 to 11.5 points)
RevV0: We'd like to bid the Spade suit, but we can't reverse with less than 17 points.
RevV2: And since the 3rd best suit (Clubs) is not strong enough to bid, we have to rebid the original Diamond suit.
B3W41: With weak support for partner'sminor Club suit (holding J82), and no other good suits, we're forced to rebid our Diamonds suit at 2 Diamonds.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<< NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!????????????PASS WITH 11 HCPs
We bid 2D.
--------------------
East doubles.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 2S.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 2 Diamonds and partner's pass.
B3A20: Partner passed, showing < 6 points, so with 11.0/10.0 points in hand and 10.0-15.0 total partnership points, we have no choice but to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of Pass, Pass, and 3 Diamonds.
B4Z00: Partner made a response which we don't understand; simply pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Diamonds.  Declarer is North; East leads.
