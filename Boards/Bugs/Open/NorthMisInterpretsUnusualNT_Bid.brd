>>>>>>> NORTH <<<<<<<
S:JT73  H:K6  D:9542  C:JT6
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 5.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.0;
Total pts = 4.0.
  QT's = 0.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: H
  Probable Stoppers in:
  2 Likely Winners (1/1/0/0)
  11 Likely Losers (3/1/4/3)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Spades.
====================
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 1D.
--------------------
South bids 2NT.
--------------------
West bids 3S.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 No Trump.
UNTR10: Partner has made an Unusual NT bid of 2 No Trump, indicating 5/5 length in Clubs and Diamonds.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< NO
UNTR12: Given a choice, we prefer the Club suit.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
3REVAL8: Since the trump suit is only topped by a Jack, deduct 2 points.
UNTR28: With a total of 10.0-15.0 pts in the partnership, respond at the 3-level with 3 Clubs.  <<<<<<<<< West bid 3S ??????
But our bid (3 Clubs) is too low vs. the last bid of of 3 Spades, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
