South bids 1S.
--------------------
West bids 2D.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Spade.
REVAL38: (with 3-card Spade trump support & a singleton in Diamonds, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 4.0 to 7.0 points)
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Spade suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 14.5-21.5 points.
ROVRC10: This is not enough to bid any higher, so pass.
We pass.

B4C10: With 5.0/4.0 points in the hand, for a total in the partnership of 17.0-23.0 points, we have to settle for the current bid and pass.
We pass.
