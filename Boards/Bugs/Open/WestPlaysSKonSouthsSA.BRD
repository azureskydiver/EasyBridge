====================================
S:K75  H:KQ863  D:K7  C:K82
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 14.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.0;
Total pts = 13.0.
  QT's = 2.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  7 Likely Winners (1/4/1/1)
  6 Likely Losers (2/1/1/2)
Playing five-card majors, Hearts can be opened.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
Opening bid for team.
Have 14.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Heart.
We bid 1H.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 1NT.
--------------------
South bids 2S.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Heart and partner's response of 1 No Trump.
With a 1NT response, partner is showing 5.5-9.5 points, a lack of good support for our Heart suit, and no other suit available to bid at an appropriate level.
And with a balanced hand, we want to steer towards a contract in No Trumps.
Have 14.0 HCPS with a balanced hand, and 19.5-23.5 pts in the partnership, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
