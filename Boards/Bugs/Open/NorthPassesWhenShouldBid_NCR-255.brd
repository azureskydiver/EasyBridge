Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suits are  Diamonds, Hearts
The best suit is Diamonds.
====================
South bids 1H.
--------------------
West bids 4C.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Heart.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL5: Adding 1 point(s) for the 1 extra trump(s).
2REVAL38: (with 4-card Heart trump support including a trump honor & a singleton in Spades, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 12.0 to 17.0 points)
F00: Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
I08: Have 12.0/12.0/17.0 points with 4-card support for partner's Hearts (holding KJ52), which is too strong for a limit raise, so we have to temporarily shift to Diamonds with a bid of 4 Diamonds.
We bid 4D.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 5S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Heart, 4 Diamonds, and 5 Spades.
PKF1: With 4 trumps in partner's first suit (Hearts), we prefer to support that suit.
B4Q02: Partner made a jump shift to 5 Spades in response to our 4 Diamonds bid, showing 19.0-22.0 points.  The bid is forcing to game.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< NOTE!!!!!!!!
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
BLKWDx: we'd like to use Blackwood, but partner has already bid higher than 4NT, so we have to pass.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<????
B4Q40: We pick Hearts for the ultimate slam contract suit.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<????????????
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 5 Spades.  Declarer is South; West leads.
