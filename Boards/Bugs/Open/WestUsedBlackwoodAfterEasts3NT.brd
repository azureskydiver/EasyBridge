S:Q83  H:J65  D:KQJ8  C:AK2
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 16.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-0.5;

  QT's = 3.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  4 Likely Winners (0/0/3/1)
  9 Likely Losers (3/3/1/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
South bids 1H.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL3: But we lack the strength for a simple overcall.
A00: Have 16.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
B00: We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.

BLKWD: with 16.0/15.5/15.5 points in the hand, for a total of approx. 32.0-32.0 / 31.5-31.5 pts in the partnership, explore slam possibilities with Blackwood at 4 No Trump.  <<<<????
