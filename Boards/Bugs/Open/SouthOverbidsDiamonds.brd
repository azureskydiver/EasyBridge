Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Diamond and partner's response of 2 Spades.
B3W00: Partner has made a 2 over 1 bid, Spades over Diamonds, which shows 9.0-17.0 points and is forcing for one round.
B3W54: With our self-supporting Diamond suit with 6 cards and 4 honors, and 15.0/15.0 points in hand, we should be able to make a game contract in the suit with little help from partner, so bid 5 Diamonds.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< ??????????
