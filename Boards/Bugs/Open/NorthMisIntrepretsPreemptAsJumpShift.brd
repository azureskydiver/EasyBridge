Opening bid for team.

We bid 1D.

East passes.

South bids 4S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Diamond and partner's response of 4 Spades.
B3Y00: Partner has made a jump shift to 4 Spades after our opening 1 Diamond bid, which indicates 18.5+ points and is forcing to game (and points to a possible slam).  <<<<<<<<<< NOT a J-S a Leap!!! <
B3Y44: With a total of 32.5-35.5 pts in the partnership but poor support for partner's suits, move towards slam in our own Diamond suit with a bid of 5 Diamonds.
We bid 5D.
