North lead singleton against 6H contract vs partner's Diamonds
>>>>>>>> NORTH <<<<
S:A753  H:872  D:K9742  C:3
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 7.0, Distn pts = 2.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 7.0.
  QT's = 1.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Likely Winners (2/0/3/0)
  8 Likely Losers (2/3/2/1)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suits are  Diamonds, Spades
The best suit is Diamonds.
====================
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2D.
--------------------
West doubles.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Diamonds.
REVAL38: (with 5-card Diamond trump support including a trump honor & a singleton in Clubs, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 7.0 to 14.0 points)
RWKT: Partner made a weak 2-bid, showing a a 6+ card suit with 5.5-10.5 points, less than 4 cards in the other major, no voids, and no more than one singleton.
We have 7.0/7.0/14.0 points, for a partnership total of 19.5-24.5 points, so we are interested in game if a good fit can be found.
RWKT21: And we like partner's Diamond suit (holding K9742 support), but with only 19.5-24.5 total pts we don't quite have enough for a direct game bid, so invite partner to show an outside Ace or King with a bid of 2NT.
We bid 2NT.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3D.
--------------------
West doubles.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 2 Diamonds, 2 No Trump, and 3 Diamonds.
RWKT2B5: Partner has returned to his original Diamond suit, indicating no interest in game, so we pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 5C.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 6H.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
