Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Heart and partner's response of 1 No Trump.
B3J00: With a 1NT response, partner is showing 5.0-9.0 points, a lack of good support for our Heart suit, and no other suit available to bid at an appropriate level.
B3J10: And with a balanced hand, we want to steer towards a contract in No Trumps.
B3J14: Have 11.0 HCPS with a balanced hand, and 16.0-20.0 pts in the partnership, so we have to pass.
We pass.
