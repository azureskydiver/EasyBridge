S:AQT4  H:JT8  D:AT76  C:A2
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 15.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;

  QT's = 3.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  6 Likely Winners (3/0/2/1)
  7 Likely Losers (1/3/2/1)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suits are  Diamonds, Spades
The best suit is Spades.
====================
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
A00: Have 15.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
A08: This meet the rqmts for the 1NT opening range (15-17), so bid 1NT.
We bid 1NT.
--------------------
East bids 2H.
--------------------
South bids 3C.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 No Trump and partner's response of 3 Clubs.
B3W00: Partner has made a 2 over 1 bid, Clubs over No Trump, which shows 9.0-17.0 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
B3W40: With poor support for partner's minor Club suit (holding A2), and our first suit not rebiddable, we have to shift to another suit at 3 Spades.
We bid 3S.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< ONLY 4 spades ???
