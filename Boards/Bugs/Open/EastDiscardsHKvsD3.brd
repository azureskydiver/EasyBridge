>>> EAST<<<<<<<
S:865  H:K542  D:KQJ93  C:T
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 9.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.0;

  QT's = 1.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  6 Likely Winners (0/2/4/0)
  7 Likely Losers (3/2/1/1)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
E07: Have 9.0 points in high cards in 3rd position and a openable Diamond suit, so bid 1 Diamond.
--------------------
South bids 1S.
--------------------
West bids 2D.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Diamond and partner's response of 2 Diamonds.
RDR0: With a single raise, partner is showing 6.0-10.0 points and decent (3-4 card) support for our Diamond suit.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
3REVAL8: Since the trump suit is only topped by a eight, deduct 0 points.
2REVAL16: (after re-evaluation for distribution, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 8.0 to 9.0 points)
RDR2: We have a total of 15.0-19.0 points in the partnership, which is not enough for game, so settle for a part score and pass.
We pass.
--------------------
South bids 2H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North bids 2S.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.
--------------------
South passes.

West passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 Spades.  Declarer is South; West leads.
