Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Club, 1 Heart, and 2 Spades.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 5.
3REVAL8: Since the trump suit is only topped by a ten, deduct 3 points.
2REVAL18: Declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract in Spades from 14.0 down to 8.0 points)
PKF5: Without a compelling suit of our own, we prefer to support partner's second suit of Spades.
B4Q02: Partner made a jump shift to 2 Spades in response to our 1 Heart bid, showing 19.0-22.0 points.  The bid is forcing to game.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Spade trump support & a doubleton in Clubs, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 14.0 to 15.0 points)
BLKWD: with 14.0/14.0/15.0 points in the hand, for a total of approx. 33.0-36.0 / 34.0-37.0 pts in the partnership, explore slam possibilities with Blackwood at 4 No Trump.
B4Q40: We pick Spades for the ultimate slam contract suit.
