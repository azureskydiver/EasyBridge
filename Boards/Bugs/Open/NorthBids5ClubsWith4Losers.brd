Responding to partner's opening bid of 3 Clubs.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL7: Adding 3 point(s) for the solid Diamond suit.
SHUTR0: Partner made a preemptive 3 Clubs bid, showing a 7-card Club suit with no tricks outside the suit, and most likely 5.0-8.0 points.
SHUTR4: We have 16.0/17.0/16.0 points in hand, for a total of 21.0-24.0 points in the partnership, strong support for partner's long Club suit (holding AQ2), plus 3.0 QTs and 6 likely winners, so we can safely bid a minor game at 5 Clubs.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<??????????? Have 4 losers???????????
We bid 5C.

East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West doubles.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 5 Clubs and partner's pass.
B3A20: Partner passed, showing < 6 points, so with 16.0/17.0 points in hand and 17.0-22.0 total partnership points, we have no choice but to pass.
We pass.
