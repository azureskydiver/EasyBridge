I did 3H pre-empt and N partner bid Clubs.... didn't understand pre-empt?
===
S:754  H:KT8753  D:Q975  C:AKQ432
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 11.0, Distn pts = 4.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 12.0.
  QT's = 2.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  8 Likely Winners (0/0/2/6)
  5 Likely Losers (3/0/2/0)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Have a powerful suit in Clubs.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 1S.
--------------------
South bids 3H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 3 Hearts.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL7: Adding 3 point(s) for the solid Club suit.
3REVAL6: Deducting 3 point(s) for the 3 trump(s) short of 3.
Partner made a strong jump overcall of 3 Hearts, indicating 14.5-17.5 pts, a good 6+ card Heart suit, and probably 6+ playing tricks.
The total point count in the partnership is therefore 26.5-29.5 points.
With a 6-card Club suit, we bid it in preference to partner's Hearts at a bid of 4 Clubs.
We bid 4C.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 4H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 3 Hearts, 4 Clubs, and 4 Hearts.
Partner made a minimum rebid of his Heart suit at 4 Hearts, showing 10.0-16.0 points and 5+ trump cards.
Pass since partner has bid game.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 4 Hearts.  Declarer is South; West leads.
