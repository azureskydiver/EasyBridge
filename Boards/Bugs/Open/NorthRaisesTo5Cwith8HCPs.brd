North raises to 5C with 8 HCPs??? Should pass
>>>>> NORTH <<<<<<<<
S:T85  H:T6  D:864  C:AKJT5
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 8.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 8.0.
  QT's = 2.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  4 Likely Winners (0/0/0/4)
  9 Likely Losers (3/2/3/1)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Have a strong suit in Clubs.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
West bids 3H.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL3: But we lack the strength for a simple overcall.
B00: We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 4D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 4 Diamonds.
REVAL38: (with 3-card Diamond trump support & a doubleton in Hearts, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 8.0 to 10.0 points)
F01: Partner, opening in fourth position, is showing 10.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
H08: Have 8.0/8.0/10.0 points  but prefer to show our own Club suit instead of raising a minor, so bid 5 Clubs.
We bid 5C.

East passes.

South passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 5 Clubs.  Declarer is North; East leads.
