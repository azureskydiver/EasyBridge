Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
South bids 1H.
--------------------
West bids 1S.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Heart.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL5: Adding 3 point(s) for the 2 extra trump(s).
2REVAL38: (with 5-card Heart trump support including a trump honor & a singleton in Diamonds, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 6.0 to 13.0 points)
F00: Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
I08: Have 7.0/6.0/13.0 points with 5-card support for partner's Hearts (holding K9752), which is too strong for a limit raise, so we have to temporarily shift to Spades with a bid of 2 Spades.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<< NO West just bid 2S ?????????
We bid 2S.

East passes.
