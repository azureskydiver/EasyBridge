Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.

South bids 1C.
--------------------
West bids 1S.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Spade.
REVAL38: (with 4-card Spade trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Clubs, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 7.0 to 10.0 points)
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Spade suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 18.0-25.0 points.
BN1: With 16.0+ HCPs in the partnership and a reasonably balanced hand, though without stoppers in all suits, bid 1 No Trump.
We bid 1NT.   <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
