What happened with bidding? West bid 3C - out of the blue - after N overcalled 2C. West only had 3 small clubs and partner had already supported his hearts..

====================
Opening bid for team.
Have 13.0 points in high cards and 3.0 quick tricks, so bid 1 Heart.
We bid 1H.
--------------------
North bids 2C.
--------------------
East bids 2H.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Heart and partner's response of 2 Hearts.
With a single raise, partner is showing 6.0-10.0 points and decent (3-4 card) support for our Heart suit.
REVAL10: (with a 6-card trump suit in Hearts, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 14.0 to 16.0 points)
Using the modified trick count, we have 6 playing tricks in hand and a total of 22.0-26.0 points in the partnership, so show the Club support suit in a bid of 3 Clubs.
We bid 3C.
--------------------
North doubles.
--------------------
East bids 3H.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
Partner has returned to our first suit, raising it to 3 Hearts.
With 22.0-26.0 points in the partnership and no aspirations for a higher contract, we sign off on partner's bid of 3 Hearts.
We pass.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Hearts.  Declarer is West; North leads.

We have only 7 sure tricks against a requirement of 9 for the 3H contract.
The Diamond suit looks the most promising for further development.
Checking play sequencing...
We want to work on developing the Diamond suit first, so move its plays up to the front if possible.
Interleaving plays...
The tentative list of available plays is as follows:
------>
 Play 1: Pull a round of trumps with the Ace in hand.
 Play 2: Ruff a Diamond in hand.
 Play 3: Ruff a Diamond in hand.
 Play 4: Cash the King of Diamonds in hand.
 Play 5: Cash the Ace of Diamonds in dummy.
 Play 6: Ruff a Club in dummy.
 Play 7: Ruff a Club in dummy.
 Play 8: Ruff a Spade in hand.
 Play 9: Ruff a Spade in hand.

 Play 14: Cash the King of Hearts in hand.
 Play 15: Cash the Ace of Hearts in hand.
