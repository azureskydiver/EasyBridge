=======================
PL03: Starting play as right-hand defender.
PLDF40: Play high with the Queen.
PLYLDRT2: We'd like to return partner's Hearts suit, but dummy will most likely win.
PLCSW9: With no other good options, cash a winner in the Heart suit, the Ace
PLYSIG1: Partner discarded low with the six, so consider it a signal that he dislikes the suit.
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Hearts.
PLYLDWN2: We'd like to lead the Hearts suit, but dummy might ruff.
PLYLD42: With no good card to lead, lead the SK since the opponents have not shown out of the Spade suit.
PLYSIG0: Partner discarded high with the ten, so consider it a suit preference signal.
PLDIS40: Indicate a preference for the Spade by discarding high with the S9.
PLAYB52: With no cards in the suit led and no trumps, we discard the S9.
RCP5A: West is now known to have started with 0 Diamonds.
