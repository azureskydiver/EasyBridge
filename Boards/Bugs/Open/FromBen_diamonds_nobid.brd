Hey Norm,
 
Been busier than usual at work so it has taken a while to get back to you.  Most of the people that I have played bridge with would consider me to be pretty agressive and I really cringe at bidding 3H with that hand.  That being said, I know that people sometimes go with feel, situation, etc. and might bid a hand that really shouldn't be bid according to strict conventions and take a chance.  That is probably my real question with regards to the computer program and I was reminded of these e-mails today because of another hand I was just playing.  I can live with bidding 3H as a pre-empt with only 2HCP and 3-4 distribution points even though I consider that to be really aggessive and goes against what I consider to the the rules of a pre-emptive-3 bid.  As long as bidding is consistent, I can adjust. 
 
Which brings me to today's hand.  Under bidding rules where 3H was bid with a maximum of 6 points under any point system, how does North Pass with the hand it has?  13HCP, 5 distribution points (some penalty for the singleton king) and a Guranteed 7 diamond tricks if the Diamond is the choice.  
Thoughts?
 
Ben
