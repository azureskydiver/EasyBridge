Playing five-card majors, Hearts can be opened.
Have a strong suit in Hearts.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
North bids 1S.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVERCL8: Have a good 6-card Heart suit with 10.0/10.0 points and 6 playing tricks, so overcall the opponents' 1 Spade with a bid of 2 Hearts.
--------------------
South bids 3D.
--------------------
West bids 4H.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 2 Hearts and partner's response of 4 Hearts.
OVRRB10: Partner raised our initial 2 Hearts overcall to 4 Hearts, indicating 3+ trumps and 14.0-21.0 points.
OVRRB60: With a total of approx. 24.0-24.0 pts in the partnership, we can raise to game at 4 Hearts.
But 4 Hearts has already been bid, so we have to pass.
We pass.

South passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 4 Hearts.  Declarer is East; South leads.
