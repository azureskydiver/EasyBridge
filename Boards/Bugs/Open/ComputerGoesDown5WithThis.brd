Computer goes down 5 with this
First need to promote Spades to winners.
Then need entry to board.
One way to get to board is if East has CK - lead to CQ; duck if CK played by East.
Another way is if East has HA - lead to HK from North

Also need to duck Diamond from West into East. Then North has DQT over East's DJ
