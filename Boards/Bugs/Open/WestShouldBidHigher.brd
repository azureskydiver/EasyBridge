Should West bid 3H (limit raise) vs 2H weak
>>>>>>> WEST<<<<<<<
S:Q72  H:6532  D:AJ7  C:A42
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 11.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 11.0.
  QT's = 2.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  3 Likely Winners (1/0/1/1)
  10 Likely Losers (2/4/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
South bids 1C.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL3: But we lack the strength for a simple overcall.
B00: We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 1H.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Heart.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL5: Adding 1 point(s) for the 1 extra trump(s).
2REVAL38: (with 4-card Heart trump support, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 11.0 to 12.0 points)
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Heart suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 20.0-27.0 points.
YN1: With 20.0-27.0 points in the partnership and 4-card support for partner's major Heart suit (holding 6532), raise to 2 Hearts.
We bid 2H.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 Hearts.  Declarer is East; South leads.
=======================

RCP5A: East is now known to have started with 1 Club.
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Clubs.
RCP5A: South is now known to have started with 2 Diamonds.
