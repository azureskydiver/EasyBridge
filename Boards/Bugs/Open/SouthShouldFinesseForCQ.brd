  8 Eventual Winners (1/1/4/2)
  5 Possible Losers (vs. 4 allowable)
PLN10: We have only 8 sure tricks against a requirement of 9 for the 3NT contract.
PLNDRP1: Looking at the hand for drop plays...
PLNDRP5: No drop plays are available.
PLNFNS0: Looking for possible finesses...
PSFNS31: Can finesse the Jack of Clubs by leading it from hand against West.
PLNFNS91: One possible finesse has been found.
PLNDEV0: Looking for ways to force out enemy top cards and promote our own......
PLNDEV30: We can play the Queen of Diamonds to force out the opponents' Ace.
PLNDEV31: This will promote the Queen, Jack, ten to winners.
nine to a winner.
PLNDEV91: One forcing play has been found, which will promote 4 lower cards.
PLNCNT2: Removed finesses because Force and Cash generate more than 3 tricks
PLNCSH1: Looking at the hand for cashes...
PLNCSH3: We can cash 1 card in Spades, plus 2 in Clubs, plus 4 in Diamonds, plus 1 in Hearts.
PLNCSH30: A total of 8 maximum cashing tricks are immediately available.

PLNPRI: The Diamond suit looks the most promising for further development.
PLSEQ: Checking play sequencing...
PLSEQ6: We want to work on developing the Diamond suit first, so move its plays up to the front if possible.
PINTLV: Interleaving plays...
PINTLV10: Postpone the [DJ Cash] so the suit winners in dummy are cashed first, to avoid possible stranding.
PINTLV10: Postpone the [DT Cash] so the suit winners in dummy are cashed first, to avoid possible stranding.
PINTLV10: Postpone the [DK Cash] so the suit winners in dummy are cashed first, to avoid possible stranding.
