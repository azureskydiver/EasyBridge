  Sure Stoppers in: S, C

====================
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
E02: Have 12.0 points in high cards and 3.0 quick tricks, so bid 1 Club.
We bid 1C.
--------------------
South bids 1D.
--------------------
West bids 1S.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Club and partner's response of 1 Spade.
B3U00a: Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid after an earlier pass, Spades over Clubs, which shows 5.0-11.0 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
RevV0: We'd like to bid the Heart suit, but we can't reverse with less than 17 points.
RevV2: And since the 3rd best suit (Diamonds) is not strong enough to bid, we have to rebid the original Club suit.
B3U18a: With poor support for partner's Spade suit (holding AK), and no other suit available to bid, rebid the Club suit at 2 Clubs.
We bid 2C.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 2D.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
BXM80: With no agreement in suits, 17.0-23.0 / 17.0-23.0 partnership points, and no good alternatives, pass.  <<<<<<<<<< NO bid 2S with AK
We pass.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 Diamonds.  Declarer is West; North leads.
