Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
South passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 1C.
--------------------
South bids 1D.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Club.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
F01: Partner, opening in fourth position, is showing 10.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
H08: Have 11.0/11.0/11.0 points  but prefer to show our own Heart suit instead of raising a minor, so bid 1 Heart.
We bid 1H.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 2H.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Club, 1 Heart, and 2 Hearts.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 5.
3REVAL8: Since the trump suit is only topped by a Queen, deduct 0 points.
2REVAL18: Declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 11.0 down to 9.0 points)
B4H11: Partner made a single raise of our Heart suit, showing 12.0-20.0 points with 3+ trump cards.
B4H18: With only 11.0/11.0/9.0 pts in hand, for a total in the partnership of 19.0-29.0 points, a game is unlikely, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 2 Hearts.  Declarer is West; North leads.
