South bids 2S.

Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Spades.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL7: Adding 1 point(s) for the solid Diamond suit.
3REVAL5: Adding 1 point(s) for the 0 extra trump(s).
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Spade trump support including a trump honor & a void in Clubs, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 15.0 to 20.0 points)
RWKT: Partner made a weak 2-bid, showing a a 6+ card suit with 5.0-10.0 points, less than 4 cards in the other major, no voids, and no more than one singleton.
We have 15.0/15.0/15.0 points, for a partnership total of 20.0-25.0 points, so we are interested in game if a good fit can be found.
RWKT21: And we like partner's Spade suit (holding Q76 support), but with only 20.0-25.0 total pts we don't quite have enough for a direct game bid, so invite partner to show an outside Ace or King with a bid of 2NT.
We bid 2NT.
