Opening bid for team.
E04: Have 11.0 points in high cards, 2.5 quick tricks, and a 5-card suit, so bid 1 Spade.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< ??????
We bid 1S.
--------------------
East passes.

South bids 2H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Spade and partner's response of 2 Hearts.
B3W00: Partner has made a 2 over 1 bid, Hearts over Spades, which shows 9.0-17.0 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
B3W41: With poor support for partner's Heart suit (holding AT), and no other good suits, we're forced to rebid our Spades suit at 2 Spades.
We bid 2S.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2NT.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
BXPNTA: Partner bid Notrump, indicating a dislike for our Spade suit.
BXPNT5: With a total of 20.0-28.0 / 20.0-28.0 pts in the partnership, we lack adequate strength for a further raise beyond partner's 2 No Trump bid, so we have to pass.
We pass.
