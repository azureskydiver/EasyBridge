TKRb51: The right-hand opponent has bid after partner's response, interfering with our communication.
YN1: With 21.0-23.0 points in the partnership and 3-card support for partner's major Heart suit (holding Q53), raise to 3 Hearts.
TKRb71a: (we can assume partner has some strength in the Heart suit, so we are shading the requirements slightly.
We bid 3H.

Responding to partner's opening double.
TKOTR: Partner has doubled for takeout.
TKORT8: Partner's takeout indicates 11.0+ HCPs, for a total in the partnership of 16.0-26.0 points.
TKOTR12: But Right-hand opponent has bid after partner's double, so the takeout is no longer in effect.
TKOTR14: However, assuming partner has 12+ HCPs, that amount combined with our 7.0/5.0 points totals 19.0/17.0 pts, which is enough for us to bid 1 Heart.
