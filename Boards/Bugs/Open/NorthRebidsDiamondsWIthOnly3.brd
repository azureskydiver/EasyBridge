>>>>>>>> NORTH <<<<<<<
S:AK76  H:86  D:A97  C:9752
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 11.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 11.0.
  QT's = 3.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  4 Likely Winners (3/0/1/0)
  9 Likely Losers (1/2/2/4)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Spades.
====================
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
E07: Have 11.0 points in high cards in 3rd position and a weak Diamond suit, so bid 1 Diamond.
We bid 1D.
--------------------
East bids 2C.
--------------------
South bids 2H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Diamond and partner's response of 2 Hearts.
B3W00a: Partner has made a 2 over 1 bid following an earlier pass, Hearts over Diamonds, which shows 9.0-11.0 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
RevV0: We'd like to bid the Spade suit, but we can't reverse with less than 17 points.
RevV2: And since the 3rd best suit (Clubs) is not strong enough to bid, we have to rebid the original Diamond suit.
B3W41: With poor support for partner's Heart suit (holding 86), and no other good suits, we're forced to rebid our Diamonds suit at 3 Diamonds.
We bid 3D.
