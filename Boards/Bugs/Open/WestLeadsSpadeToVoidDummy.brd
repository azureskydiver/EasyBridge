====================

--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Spades.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
ROVRC3: Partner made a weak jump overcall of 2 Spades, indicating 5.0-9.0 pts and a good 6+ card Spade suit.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 18.0-22.0 points.
ROVRC99: We have insufficient strength for either a raise, suit shift, or NT bid, so pass.
We pass.

=======================
PL03: Starting play as right-hand defender.
PLDIS2: Since we can win the next round of Clubs, we want to signal by discarding high in the suit.
PLDIS8: Begin the high-low signal with the nine.
PLDF48: We can't beat South's Ace, so discard the C9.
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Spades.
PLAYDF2: Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
PLDF2H5: Cover with the winner Ace.
PLDF2H3: Cover with the Ace.
PLYLD33: Partner has bid the Spades suit, so lead the SQ.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< NO DUMMY IS VOID!!!
