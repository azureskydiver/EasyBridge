Opening bid for team.
E01: Have 15.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Diamond.
We bid 1D.

North bids 2C.

East bids 2S.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Diamond and partner's response of 2 Spades.
B3W00: Partner has made a 2 over 1 bid, Spades over Diamonds, which shows 9.0-17.0 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL7: Adding 3 point(s) for the solid Diamond suit.
3REVAL5: Adding 3 point(s) for the 0 extra trump(s).
4REVAL21: Adjusting by -1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Spade trump support including a trump honor & doubletons in Clubs and Hearts, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 15.0 to 18.5 points)
B3W54: With our self-supporting Diamond suit with 6 cards and 4 honors, and 15.0/15.0 points in hand, we should be able to make a game contract in the suit with little help from partner, so bid 5 Diamonds.
We bid 5D.
