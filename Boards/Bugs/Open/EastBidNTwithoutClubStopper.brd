East shouldn't bid NT without a Club stopper
>>>EAST<<<<<<<<
S:A98  H:K75  D:A85  C:7542
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 11.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0; Total pts = 11.0.
  QT's = 2.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  -1 Likely Winners (0/0/0/-1)
  14 Likely Losers (3/3/3/5)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North bids 1H.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL3: But we lack the strength for a simple overcall.
TKOUT: With 11.0/11.0 points and support for all unbid suits, bid a takeout double.
We bid Dbl.
--------------------
South bids 2C.
--------------------
West bids 2H.
--------------------
North bids 3H.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of Double and partner's response of 2 Hearts.
TKORb40: Partner has responded in the enemy suit, indicating 13+ pts but no long suits.
TKRb49: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 24.0-33.0 pts.
TKRb51: The right-hand opponent has bid after partner's response, interfering with our communication.
TKRb80: Without clear suit agreement, and holding a blanaced hand, we want to steer towards a contract in No Trump.
BN1: With 24.0+ HCPs in the partnership and a reasonably balanced hand, though without stoppers in all suits, bid 3 No Trump.
We bid 3NT.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< NO CLUB STOPPER. SOUTH BID Clubs
--------------------
South doubles.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 3 No Trump and partner's pass.
B3A20: Partner passed, showing < 6 points, so with 11.0/11.0 points in hand and 11.0-16.0 total partnership points, we have no choice but to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 No Trump (doubled).  Declarer is East; South leads.
