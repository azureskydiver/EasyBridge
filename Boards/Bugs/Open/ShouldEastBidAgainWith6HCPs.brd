>>>>>>>> EAST<<<<<<<<<
S:93  H:AQ9865  D:753  C:82
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 6.0, Distn pts = 3.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 7.0.
  QT's = 1.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: H
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Likely Winners (0/5/0/0)
  8 Likely Losers (2/1/3/2)
Playing five-card majors, Hearts can be opened.
Have a strong suit in Hearts.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================

--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Diamond.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Diamond trump support & doubletons in Clubs and Spades, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 7.0 to 8.0 points)
F00: Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
F01a: Have 6.0/7.0/8.0 pts with an available 6-card major suit in Hearts (AQ9865), so bid 1 Heart over partner's minor suit 1 Diamond bid.
We bid 1H.

REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
PKF3: With three suits bid so far, we prefer to rebid our own 6-card Heart suit.
B4P16: With 6.0/7.0 points in hand, for a total in the partnership of 19.0-25.0 points, and a preference for partner's first suit, we shift back to 4 Diamonds.

--------------------
West bids 5D.
--------------------
North passes.
