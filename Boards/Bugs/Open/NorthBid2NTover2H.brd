====================
South bids 2H.
--------------------
West doubles.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Hearts.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Heart trump support including a trump honor & a singleton in Clubs, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 7.0 to 11.0 points)
RSTRT: Partner made a strong 2-bid, showing a very good suit or two solid suits, 9+ playing tricks, and 4+ quick tricks.  We have to respond positively if interested in slam, or negatively otherwise.
RSTRT10: But with only 0.5 QT's, we have to make the negative response of 2 No Trump to deny slam values.
We bid 2NT.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3H.
--------------------
West doubles.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 2 Hearts, 2 No Trump, and 3 Hearts.
B4C1: Partner made a minimum rebid of his Heart suit at 3 Hearts after his initial strong 2 Hearts opening, showing 21.0+ points and 5+ trump cards.
BN1: With 29.0+ HCPs in the partnership and a reasonably balanced hand, though without stoppers in all suits, bid 3 No Trump.
We bid 3NT.
