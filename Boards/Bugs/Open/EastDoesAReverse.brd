Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Club and partner's response of 1 Spade.
B3U00: Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid, Spades over Clubs, which shows 5.5-17.5 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
B3U18: With poor support for partner's Spade suit (holding 64), and a second openable suit in Diamonds (holding K9842), show it in a 2 Diamonds bid.
We bid 2D.
