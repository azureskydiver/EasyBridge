Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVERCL8: Have a good 5-card Club suit with 14.0/14.0 points and 4 playing tricks, so overcall the opponents' 1 Diamond with a bid of 2 Clubs.
We bid 2C.

North bids 3C.

=======================
PL02: Starting play as left-hand defender.
PLYLEAD: Making opening lead as West against a contract of 3 No Trump.
PLYLD4A: Lead the fourth card from our best suit (Clubs) -- play the C5.
PLYSIG1: Partner discarded low with the two, so consider it a signal that he dislikes the suit.
PLAYDF2: Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
PLDF2E: South led an honor (the ten), so cover it with our King.
RCP5A: East is now known to have started with 1 Club.
