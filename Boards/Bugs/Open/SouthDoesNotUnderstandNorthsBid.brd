Rebidding after opening bid of 2 Hearts and partner's response of 2 No Trump.
B3Z00: Partner made a response which we don't understand; simply pass.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< 2NT

  Sure Stoppers in: H, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Likely Winners (-1/0/6/0)
  8 Likely Losers (4/3/0/1)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Have a powerful suit in Diamonds.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
South bids 2H.

Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Hearts.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL7: Adding 3 point(s) for the solid Diamond suit.
3REVAL5: Adding 3 point(s) for the 0 extra trump(s).
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Heart trump support including a trump honor & a singleton in Clubs, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 14.0 to 19.0 points)
RWKT: Partner made a weak 2-bid, showing a a 6+ card suit with 5.0-10.0 points, less than 4 cards in the other major, no voids, and no more than one singleton.
We have 13.0/14.0/13.0 points, for a partnership total of 18.0-23.0 points, so we are interested in game if a good fit can be found.
RWKT21: And we like partner's Heart suit (holding K96 support), but with only 18.0-23.0 total pts we don't quite have enough for a direct game bid, so invite partner to show an outside Ace or King with a bid of 2NT.    <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
We bid 2NT.
