--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Spades.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
ROVRC5: Partner overcalled at the 2-level, indicating a good 5+ card Spade suit, 9.0-14.0 points, and probably 6+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 25.0-30.0 points.
ROVRC26: With a 6-card Diamond suit and 16.0 points, we jump in it in preference to partner's Spades at a bid of 4 Diamonds.
We bid 4D.
