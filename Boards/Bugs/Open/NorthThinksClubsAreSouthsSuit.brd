S:T4  H:AQ3  D:AK2  C:AQ873
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 19.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 19.0.
  QT's = 5.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  8 Likely Winners (0/2/2/4)
  5 Likely Losers (2/1/1/1)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
South bids 2H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Hearts.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Heart trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Spades, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 19.0 to 21.0 points)
RWKT: Partner made a weak 2-bid, showing a a 6+ card suit with 5.0-10.0 points, less than 4 cards in the other major, no voids, and no more than one singleton.
RWKT40: We have 19.0/19.0/21.0 points, for a partnership total of 26.0-31.0 points, so we may be interested in a possible slam.
RWKT48: We don't have very good support for partner's Heart suit (holding AQ3, and don't have the proper distribution for a NT response, so jump shift to 4 Clubs.  Slam possibilities may be explored later.
We bid 4C.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 5C.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 2 Hearts, 4 Clubs, and 5 Clubs.
B4Q42b: We'll support partner's suit, so we bid 6 Clubs.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< Clubs are NOT pard's suit, Hearts are?????
We bid 6C.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 6 Clubs.  Declarer is North; East leads.
