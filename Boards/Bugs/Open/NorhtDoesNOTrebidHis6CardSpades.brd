--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.

We bid 1S.

Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Spade and partner's response of 2 Hearts.
OVRRB22: Partner bid his own Hearts suit at the 2 level in response to our 1 Spade overcall, indicating 6+ cards and approx. 12.0-14.0 points.
YN1: With 21.5-23.5 points in the partnership and 2-card support for partner's major Heart suit (holding J3), raise to 3 Hearts.
We bid 3H.   <<<<<<<<<< NOT WITH 2, rebid SPADES with 6>>>>>>>>>>

3REVAL6: Deducting 6 point(s) for the 3 trump(s) short of 5.
3REVAL8: Since the trump suit is only topped by a Ace, deduct 2 points.
2REVAL18: Declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 9.5 down to -1.0 points)
BXM81: We've reached agreement in suits, but with only 11.0-13.0 total points we can't raise partner's 4 Hearts bid any further, so pass.  <<<< Why raise 4H its GAME!!!
We pass.
