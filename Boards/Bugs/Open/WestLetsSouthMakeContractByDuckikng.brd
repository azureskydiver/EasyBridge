West lets South make contract by NOT playing CAK
>>>>>>>> WEST <<<<<<<<<
S:AK65  H:AQ52  D:9  C:AK65
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 20.0, Distn pts = 2.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 20.0.
  QT's = 5.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  9 Likely Winners (3/3/0/3)
  4 Likely Losers (1/1/1/1)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suits are  Clubs, Hearts, Spades
The best suit is Spades.
====================
South bids 3D.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
TKOUT: With 20.0/20.0 points and support for all unbid suits, bid a takeout double.
We bid Dbl.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 3S.
--------------------
South bids 4D.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of Double and partner's response of 3 Spades.
TKORb43: Partner has made a minimum response of 3 Spades, indicating no more than 9 points.
TKRb49: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 22.0-29.0 pts.
TKRb51: The right-hand opponent has bid after partner's response, interfering with our communication.
TKRb72: With a total of 22.0-29.0 points in the partnership, we have insufficient strength to raise partner's 3 Spades bid, so we have to pass.
TSTDBL4: But upon reconsideration, we have at least 5 likely tricks in the hand, so we can double for penalties.
We bid Dbl.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 4 Diamonds (doubled).  Declarer is South; West leads.
=======================
PL02: Starting play as left-hand defender.
PLYLEAD: Making opening lead as West against a contract of 4 Diamonds.
PLYLD4: Lead the Ace of partner's Spade.
PLYLDPRF4: Partner has indicated a preference for the Spades suit, so lead the SK.
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Spades.
PLYLDPRF1: Partner likes the Spade suit, but dummy can ruff, so skip this suit for now.
PLYLD33: Partner has bid the Spades suit, so lead the S5.
RCP5A: South is now known to have started with 2 Spades.
PLAYB48: We can't beat North's Ace, so discard the D9.
PLAYB23: We can't beat the opponent's three of trumps, so discard the H2.
PLAYDF2: Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
PLDF2H2: As second hand, play the lowest card we have in the suit, the five.   <<<<<<<<<<<<< NO TAKE CA and CK to set contract
PLAYB34: Partner's ten is high, so discard the C6.
PLAYCL: South has claimed the remaining 6 tricks.
RESULT: North/South made the contract.
