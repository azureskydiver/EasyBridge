Opening bid for team.
A00: Have 21.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
A20: This meets the rqmts for a 2NT opening (20-21), so bid 2NT.
We bid 2NT.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 3NT.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 2 No Trump and partner's response of 3 No Trump.
NT10: Partner's raise from our 2 No Trump to 3 No Trump indicates a balanced hand and 4.0-10.0 HCPs, for a total of 25.0+ HCPs in the partnership.
B3N18: With approx. 25.0-31.0 HCPS in the partnership, partner's game bid of 3NT seems appropriate, so pass.
We pass.
