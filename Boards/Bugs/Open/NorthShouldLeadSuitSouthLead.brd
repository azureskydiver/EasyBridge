PL03: Starting play as right-hand defender.
PLDIS2: Since we can win the next round of Hearts, we want to signal by discarding high in the suit.
PLDIS8: Begin the high-low signal with the Jack.
PLDF36: Partner's ten is high or we can't beat the highest card, so discard the HJ.
PLAYB48: We can't beat East's Ace, so discard the ST.
PLAYB41: Play the King to win the trick.
PLCSW9: With no other good options, cash a winner in the Heart suit, the King
PLYLD42: With no good card to lead, lead the DJ since the opponents have not shown out of the Diamond suit.  <<<<<<<<<<<<NO return South's suit
