East makes a poor TkODbl of 2C bid with 5 clubs
>>>>>>>>> EAST<<<<
S:Q97  H:KJ3  D:K4  C:AQ876
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 15.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 15.0.
  QT's = 2.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  7 Likely Winners (1/1/1/4)
  6 Likely Losers (2/2/1/1)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
South bids 1D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North bids 2C.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL6a: But we don't have a suit strong enough to overcall with at the 2-level.
TKOUT: With 15.0/15.0 points and support for all unbid suits, bid a takeout double.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<< NOT WITH 5 Clubs ?????????
We bid Dbl.
--------------------
South bids 2D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North bids 2NT.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of Double and partner's pass.
TKOUT: With 15.0/15.0 points and support for all unbid suits, bid a takeout doubleagain.
We bid Dbl.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 3H.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of Double and partner's response of 3 Hearts.
TKORb43: Partner has made a minimum response of 3 Hearts, indicating no more than 9 points.
TKRb49: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 19.0-24.0 pts.
TKRb72: With a total of 19.0-24.0 points in the partnership, we have insufficient strength to raise partner's 3 Hearts bid, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
South doubles.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Hearts (doubled).  Declarer is West; North leads.
=======================
RCP5A: North is now known to have started with 1 Diamond.
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Diamonds.
PLAYB48: We can't beat North's King, so discard the S7.
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Spades.
