====================
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 1NT.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL6a: But we don't have a suit strong enough to overcall with at the 2-level.
TKOUT: With 12.0/11.0 points and support for all unbid suits, bid a takeout double. <<<<<<<< NO!!!!!!
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of Double and partner's response of 2 Hearts.
TKORb43: Partner has made a minimum response of 2 Hearts, indicating no more than 9 points.
TKRb49: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 11.0-20.0 pts.
TKRb90: With a total of 11.0-20.0 points in the partnership, we have insufficient strength to raise partner's 2 Hearts bid, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 Hearts.  Declarer is South; West leads.
