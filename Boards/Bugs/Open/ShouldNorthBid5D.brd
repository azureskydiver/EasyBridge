Should North Bid 5D??
>>>>>>>>> NORTH<<<<<<<<
S:AK84  H:AK9  D:AT75  C:QT
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 20.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 20.0.
  QT's = 5.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  7 Likely Winners (3/2/2/0)
  6 Likely Losers (1/1/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suits are  Diamonds, Spades
The best suit is Spades.
====================
South bids 3D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 3 Diamonds.
REVAL38: (with 4-card Diamond trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Clubs, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 20.0 to 21.0 points)
SHUTR0: Partner made a preemptive 3 Diamonds bid, showing a 7-card Diamond suit with no tricks outside the suit, and most likely 5.5-8.5 points.
SHUTR9: With 20.0/20.0/21.0 points in hand, for a total of 26.5-29.5 points in the partnership, holding AT75 in support of partner's Diamond suit, and with only 5.0 QTs and 7 likely winners, we have no real reason to bid anything, so just pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Diamonds.  Declarer is South; West leads.
=======================
RCP5A: South is now known to have started with 1 Spade.
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Hearts.
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Clubs.
PLAYCL: South has claimed the remaining 5 tricks.
RESULT: North/South made 2 overtricks.
