--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVERCL8: Have a good 6-card Spade suit with 10.5/10.5 points and 6 playing tricks, so overcall the opponents' 1 Heart with a bid of 1 Spade.
We bid 1S.
--------------------
North bids 2C.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2D.
--------------------

Bidding finished; contract is 2 Diamonds.  Declarer is North; East leads.
=======================
PL03: Starting play as right-hand defender.
PLDF38A: Playing third ahead of dummy, we need to beat dummy's Jack, so play the Ace.
PLYLDRT8: Return partner's Spade suit with the three.
PLYSIG0: Partner discarded high with the ten, so consider it a suit preference signal.
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Spades.
RCP5A: East is now known to have started with 0 Diamonds.
PLAYB48: We can't beat North's King, so discard the D2.
PLAYB48: We can't beat South's Ace, so discard the D4.
PLAYDF2: Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
PLDF2E: South led an honor (the ten), so cover it with our Jack.
PLAYB41: Play the Ace to win the trick.
PLYLDPRF1: Partner likes the Spade suit, but dummy can ruff, so skip this suit for now.
PLYLD43: With no good card to lead, lead the CK since dummy is not void in the Club suit (we don't know about declarer, though).  <<<<<<<< C is singleton!!!
PLYSIG0: Partner discarded high with the five, so consider it a suit preference signal.
