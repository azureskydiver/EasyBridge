====================
***Bidding restarted***
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 1H.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Heart.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL5: Adding 1 point(s) for the 1 extra trump(s).
2REVAL38: (with 4-card Heart trump support including a trump honor, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 10.5 to 12.5 points)
F00: Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
I08: Have 11.0/10.5/12.5 points with 4-card support for partner's Hearts (holding A985), which is too strong for a limit raise, so we have to temporarily shift to Spades with a bid of 1 Spade.
We bid 1S.
