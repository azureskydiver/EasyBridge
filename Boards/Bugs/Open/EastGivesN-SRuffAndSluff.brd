S:K942  H:KQ65  D:T65  C:75
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 8.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.0;
Total pts = 7.0.
  QT's = 1.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Likely Winners (2/3/0/0)
  8 Likely Losers (2/1/3/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
South bids 1C.
--------------------
West bids 1S.
--------------------
North bids 2H.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Spade.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL5: Adding 1 point(s) for the 1 extra trump(s).
2REVAL38: (with 4-card Spade trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Clubs, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 7.0 to 11.0 points)
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Spade suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 18.0-25.0 points.
YN1: With 18.0-25.0 points in the partnership and 4-card support for partner's major Spade suit (holding K942), raise to 2 Spades.
We bid 2S.
--------------------
South bids 4C.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 2 Spades and partner's pass.
B3A20: Partner passed, showing < 6 points, so with 8.0/7.0 points in hand and 11.0-20.0 total partnership points, we have no choice but to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 4 Clubs.  Declarer is South; West leads.
=======================
PL03: Starting play as right-hand defender.
PLDIS2: Since we can win the next round of Spades, we want to signal by discarding high in the suit.
PLDIS8: Begin the high-low signal with the nine.
PLDF47: Partner's Ace can win the trick, so discard the S9.
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Spades.
PLDF40a: Play higher with the King.
PLYLDRT1: We'd like to return partner's Spades suit, but dummy might ruff.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<YES
PLYLDRT8: Return partner's Spade suit with the four.
