Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Diamond.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Diamond suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 15.0-22.0 points.
BN1: With 16.0+ HCPs in the partnership and a reasonably balanced hand, though without stoppers in all suits, bid 1 No Trump.
We bid 1NT.

West bids 2NT.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Diamond, 1 No Trump, and 2 No Trump.
NT10: Partner's raise from our 1 No Trump to 2 No Trump indicates a balanced hand and 13.0-14.0 HCPs, for a total of 22.0+ HCPs in the partnership.
B4F14: with 9.0/8.0 points in hand, and a total of 22.0-23.0 in the partnership, sign off on partner's contract of 2NT.
We pass.
--------------------
