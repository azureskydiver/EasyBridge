North thinks South's 2C overcall is a Strong 2C openning
S:7  H:63  D:A9864  C:AQJ74
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 11.0, Distn pts = 3.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 11.0.
  QT's = 2.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  7 Likely Winners (0/0/3/4)
  6 Likely Losers (1/2/2/1)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suits are  Clubs, Diamonds
The best suit is Clubs.
====================
Opening bid for team.
Have 11.0 points in high cards, 2.5 quick tricks, and a rebiddable suit in Clubs, so bid 1 Club.
We bid 1C.
--------------------
East bids 1S.
--------------------
South bids 2C.
--------------------
West bids 2S.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Club and partner's response of 2 Clubs.
With a single raise, partner is showing 6.0-10.0 points and decent (3-4 card) support for our Club suit.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
2REVAL16: (after re-evaluation for distribution, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 11.0 to 14.0 points)
We have a total of 20.0-24.0 points in the partnership, which is not enough for a further raise, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3C.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 2 Clubs, Pass, and 3 Clubs.           ???????????????????????? NOT Strong ??????
Partner made a minimum rebid of his Club suit at 3 Clubs after his initial strong 2 Clubs opening, showing 23.0+ points and 5+ trump cards.
With 37.0-37.0 points in the partnership, we want to explore slam opportunities.
with 11.0/11.0/14.0 points in the hand, for a total of approx. 34.0-34.0 / 37.0-37.0 pts in the partnership, explore slam possibilities with Blackwood at 4 No Trump.
We bid 4NT.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 5C.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 4.
Partner responded to our 4NT Blackwood inquiry with 5 Clubs, indicating 0 Aces.
Without all four aces we can't proceed to a grand slam, so stop at Pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 5 Clubs.  Declarer is North; East leads.
