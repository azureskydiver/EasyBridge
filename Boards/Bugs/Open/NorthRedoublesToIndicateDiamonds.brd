North redoubles to indicate he has Diamonds ????
>>>>>> NORTH <<<<<<<<<
S:Q765  H:974  D:AK9862  C:6543
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 7.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 8.0.
  QT's = 2.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Likely Winners (0/0/5/0)
  8 Likely Losers (0/3/1/4)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Have a strong suit in Diamonds.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
South bids 2S.
--------------------
West doubles.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Spades.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 6 point(s) for the 3 trump(s) short of 3.
RWKT: Partner made a weak 2-bid, showing a a 6+ card suit with 5.5-10.5 points, less than 4 cards in the other major, no voids, and no more than one singleton.
RWKT4: We only have 7.0/8.0/8.0 points, for a partnership total of 13.5-18.5 points, which is probably not enough for game.
RWKT8: And we don't like partner's Spade suit (holding void), so shift to our preferred Diamond suit in a bid of Redouble.
We bid Redbl.  <<<<<<<<<<<<????????
