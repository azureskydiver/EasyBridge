Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Diamond, 1 No Trump, and 3 Spades.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
3REVAL8: Since the trump suit is only topped by a Jack, deduct 2 points.
2REVAL16: (after re-evaluation for distribution, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 5.0 to 7.0 points)
PKF2: With 5 trumps in partner's second suit (Spades), we prefer to support that suit.
B4Q02: Partner made a jump shift to 3 Spades in response to our 1 No Trump bid, showing 19.0-22.0 points.  The bid is forcing to game.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL5: Adding 3 point(s) for the 2 extra trump(s).
4REVAL21: Adjusting by 1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 5-card Spade trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Hearts,  & a void in Diamonds, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 5.0 to 15.0 points)
BLKWD: with 5.0/5.0/15.0 points in the hand, for a total of approx. 24.0-27.0 / 34.0-37.0 pts in the partnership, explore slam possibilities with Blackwood at 4 No Trump. <<<< ????
B4Q40: We pick Spades for the ultimate slam contract suit.
