PLN10: We have only 7 sure tricks against a requirement of 9 for the 3NT contract.
PLNPRI: The Spade suit looks the most promising for further development.
PLSEQ: Checking play sequencing...
PLSEQ6: We want to work on developing the Spade suit first, so move its plays up to the front if possible.
PINTLV: Interleaving plays...
PINTLV70: Try to cross over to hand with the [HA Cash] when possible to use the [SQ Finesse].
PLN90: The tentative list of available plays is as follows:
------>
 Play 1: Cash the Ace of Hearts in hand.
 Play 2: Lead a low Spade from hand and finesse the Queen in dummy against North.
 Play 3: Lead a low Spade from hand and finesse the King in dummy against North.
 Play 4: Cash the King of Spades in dummy.
 Play 5: Lead a low Club from dummy to finesse the Jack in hand against South, with the King as cover.

---------------------------
PLCSH56: Discard a Heart from dummy in anticipation of cashing the Ace in hand.
PLCSH80: the opponents led a Heart, so see if we can finish up the cash play here.
PLCSH85: We can actually play the King to win this trick, so postpone the cash of the Ace.
PLYTRY: No usable plays found for the current situation.
PLYE41: Play the King to win the trick.
PLNADJ: Reviewing play plan for round 2...
PLRV10: We have only 5 reasonably sure tricks left vs. 8 more trick(s) required for the contract.
PLSEQ: Checking play sequencing...
