Playing five-card majors, Hearts can be opened.
Have a powerful suit in Hearts.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
Opening bid for team.
D00: Have a 8-card Heart suit with no tricks outside the suit, so make a shutout bid of 4 Hearts.
We bid 4H.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 6H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 4 Hearts and partner's response of 6 Hearts.
B3Y00: Partner has made a jump shift to 6 Hearts after our opening 4 Hearts bid, which indicates 18.0+ points and is forcing to game (and points to a possible slam).   <<<<<<<<<< NOT JUMP SHIFT <<<<<<<<????? Possible SLAM????
REVAL38: (with 8-card Heart trump support including a trump honor & a singleton in Diamonds,  & a void in Clubs, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 14.0 to 27.0 points)
B3Y40b: Partner has bid a small slam at 6 Hearts, but with 45.0-48.0 pts in the partnership, go ahead and raise to a grand slam at 7 Hearts.
We bid 7H.

East passes.

South passes.

West doubles.

Rebidding after opening bid of 7 Hearts and partner's pass.
B3A20: Partner passed, showing < 6 points, so with 9.0/14.0 points in hand and 14.0-19.0 total partnership points, we have no choice but to pass.
We pass.
