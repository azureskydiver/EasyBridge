REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL5: Adding 1 point(s) for the 1 extra trump(s).
4REVAL21: Adjusting by 1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 4-card Heart trump support including a trump honor & a singleton in Clubs, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 12.0 to 17.0 points)
RWKT: Partner made a weak 2-bid, showing a a 6+ card suit with 5.0-10.0 points, less than 4 cards in the other major, no voids, and no more than one singleton.
We have 12.0/12.0/12.0 points, for a partnership total of 17.0-22.0 points, so we are interested in game if a good fit can be found.
RWKT21: And we like partner's Heart suit (holding K762 support), but with only 17.0-22.0 total pts we don't quite have enough for a direct game bid, so invite partner to show an outside Ace or King with a bid of 2NT.    <<<<<<<<<<<<<<< NOTE Asking for feature
We bid 2NT.  
--------------------
East passes.

South bids 3C.

Rebidding as responder after bids of 2 Hearts, 2 No Trump, and 3 Clubs.
RWKT2B2: Partner has shown an outside Ace or King in the Club suit, but with a total of 17.0-22.0 pts in the partnership we lack the strength to raise further, so return to partner's suit at 3 Hearts.
We bid 3H.
