Should North bid higher than 2S???
>>>>>>>>> NORTH<<<<<<<
S:853  H:AQT3  D:2  C:KQ865
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 11.0, Distn pts = 2.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 11.0.
  QT's = 2.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  4 Likely Winners (-1/2/0/3)
  9 Likely Losers (4/2/1/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suits are  Clubs, Hearts
The best suit is Clubs.
====================
East bids 1D.
--------------------
South bids 1S.
--------------------
West doubles.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Spade.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Spade trump support & a singleton in Diamonds, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 11.0 to 13.0 points)
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Spade suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 20.0-27.0 points.
YN1: With 20.0-27.0 points in the partnership and 3-card support for partner's major Spade suit (holding 853), raise to 2 Spades.  <<<<<<<<<<<< Why only 2 ???
We bid 2S.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 Spades.  Declarer is South; West leads.
