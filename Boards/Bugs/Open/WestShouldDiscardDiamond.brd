PLNPRI: The Club suit looks the most promising for further development.
PLSEQ: Checking play sequencing...
PLSEQ6: We want to work on developing the Club suit first, so move its plays up to the front if possible.
PINTLV: Interleaving plays...
PLN90: The tentative list of available plays is as follows:
------>
 Play 1: Lead the Club Queen from hand and finesse it, with the Ace in dummy as cover.
 Play 2: Lead a low Club from dummy and finesse the Jack in hand against North.
 Play 3: Lead a low Club from dummy and finesse the Queen in hand against North.
 Play 4: Play the Jack of Clubs from hand to force out the opponents' King.
 Play 5: Play the Jack of Clubs from hand to force out the opponents' Ten.
 Play 6: Play the Jack of Clubs from hand to force out the opponents' Five.
 Play 7: Cash the Eight of Clubs in dummy.
