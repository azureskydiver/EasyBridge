West lets North get cheap trick
>>>>WEST<<<<<<<<<<,
S:9843  H:K85  D:K76  C:Q96
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 8.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.0;
Total pts = 7.0.
  QT's = 1.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  -1 Likely Winners (-1/0/0/0)
  14 Likely Losers (5/3/3/3)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Spades.
====================
Opening bid for team.
Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North bids 1H.
--------------------
East bids 1S.
--------------------
South bids 2D.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Spade.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL5: Adding 1 point(s) for the 1 extra trump(s).
2REVAL38: (with 4-card Spade trump support, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 7.0 to 8.0 points)
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Spade suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 15.0-22.0 points.
BN1: With 15.0+ HCPs in the partnership and a reasonably balanced hand, though without stoppers in all suits, bid 1 No Trump.
But our bid (1 No Trump) is too low vs. the last bid of of 2 Diamonds, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North bids 2NT.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3NT.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 No Trump.  Declarer is North; East leads.
