South won't bid at one level with 13 pts???
>>>>>>>>> SOUTH<<<<<<<<<
S:AKT743  H:742  D:3  C:KQ3
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 12.0, Distn pts = 3.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 13.0.
  QT's = 3.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  4 Likely Winners (4/-1/0/1)
  9 Likely Losers (2/4/1/2)
Playing five-card majors, Spades can be opened.
Have a strong suit in Spades.
Preferred suit is Spades.
====================
West bids 1D.
--------------------
North bids 1H.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Heart.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 5.
3REVAL8: Since the trump suit is only topped by a Ace, deduct 6 points.
2REVAL18: Declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract in Hearts from 13.0 down to 4.0 points)
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Heart suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 11.0-18.0 points.
ROVRC20: And although we want to bid our own 6-card Spade suit, we can't bid it at the 1 with only 13.0 points, so pass.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<?????????????????
