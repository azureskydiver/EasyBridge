North should put South back in Hearts with 5 Hearts with HK
>>>>>>> NORTH <<<<<<<
=====================================
Received hand:
  S:7  H:KT983  D:QT853  C:73
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 5.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.0;
Total pts = 4.0.
  QT's = 0.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  6 Likely Winners (0/3/3/0)
  7 Likely Losers (1/2/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, Hearts can be opened.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
South bids 1H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Heart.
REVAL38: (with 5-card Heart trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Clubs,  & a singleton in Spades, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 4.0 to 13.0 points)
F00: Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
I08: Have 5.0/4.0/13.0 points with 5-card support for partner's Hearts (holding KT983), which is too strong for a limit raise, so we have to temporarily shift to Diamonds with a bid of 2 Diamonds.
We bid 2D.
--------------------
East doubles.
--------------------
South bids 3D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Heart, 2 Diamonds, and 3 Diamonds.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
3REVAL8: Since the trump suit is only topped by a seven, deduct 1 points.
B4H14: Partner made a single raise of our 2 Diamonds bid to 3 Diamonds, showing 12.0 -20.5 points and 3+ trump cards.
B4H30: With only 5.0/4.0/4.0 pts in hand, for a total in the partnership of 16.0-24.5 points, a game is unlikely, so pass. <<<<< Back to HEARTS
We pass. 
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Diamonds.  Declarer is North; East leads.
=======================
PLAY: East leads the CQ.
