=======================
Starting play as right-hand defender.
Play our only card in the suit, the five.
Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
Play second hand low with the five.
Since we can win the next round of Hearts, we want to signal by discarding high in the suit.
Begin the high-low signal with the eight.
Partner's Ace can win the trick, so discard the H8.
Partner's six might not win the round, so top it with the Jack.
North is now known to have started with 1 Heart.   <<<<<<<<<<<< North VOID in hearts !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Dummy is now out of Clubs.
Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
Indicate a preference for the Spade by discarding high with the S9.
We have no Clubs and no trumps, so discard the S9.
West is now known to have started with 2 Clubs.
East is now known to have started with 3 Clubs.
With no cards in the suit led and no trumps, we discard the S2.
Dummy is now out of Diamonds.
With no cards in the suit led and no trumps, we discard the H5.
With no cards in the suit led and no trumps, we discard the S4.   <<<<<<<<<<< NO need to protect SQ
With no cards in the suit led and no trumps, we discard the HQ.
We can't beat North's King, so discard the SJ.
Dummy is now out of Spades.
Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
We have no Spades and no trumps, so discard the HK.
North/South made 1 overtrick.
