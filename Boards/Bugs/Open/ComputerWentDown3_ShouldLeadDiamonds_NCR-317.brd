PLN10: We have only 7 sure tricks against a requirement of 10 for the 4H contract.

PLNRF1: We can potentially ruff up to 2 Diamonds in hand after discarding the 1 loser from hand.
PLNRF5: Up to 3 ruffs can be used (1 in dummy/2 in hand) out of a total of 4 available, but require 1 discard(s) first.
PLNRF8: This consists of the { D5 } from hand.

PLNCSH3: We can cash 2 cards in Spades, plus 1 in Clubs, plus 2 in Diamonds, plus 2 in Hearts.
