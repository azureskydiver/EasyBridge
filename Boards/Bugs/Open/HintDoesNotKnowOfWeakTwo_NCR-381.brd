S:92  H:KJ8754  D:J  C:K875
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 8.0, Distn pts = 4.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.5;
Total pts = 7.5.
  QT's = 1.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Likely Winners (0/4/0/1)
  8 Likely Losers (2/2/1/3)
Playing five-card majors, Hearts can be opened.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
Opening bid for team.
WEAK2: Have a good 6-card Heart suit with 8.0/7.5 points (less than normal opening requirements), so bid a weak 2 Hearts.  <<<<<<<<< OK
We bid 2H.
--------------------
West passes.

North bids 2NT.

Rebidding after opening bid of 2 Hearts and partner's response of 2 No Trump.  <<<<<<<<<< WeakTwo response see below
B3Z00: Partner made a response which we don't understand; simply pass. <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< ????

The best suit is Diamonds.
====================
South bids 2H.

Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Hearts.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL5: Adding 1 point(s) for the 1 extra trump(s).
4REVAL21: Adjusting by 1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 4-card Heart trump support including a trump honor & a singleton in Clubs, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 13.5 to 18.5 points)
RWKT: Partner made a weak 2-bid, showing a a 6+ card suit with 5.0-10.0 points, less than 4 cards in the other major, no voids, and no more than one singleton.
We have 14.0/13.5/14.0 points, for a partnership total of 19.0-24.0 points, so we are interested in game if a good fit can be found.
RWKT21: And we like partner's Heart suit (holding AQ62 support), but with only 19.0-24.0 total pts we don't quite have enough for a direct game bid, so invite partner to show an outside Ace or King with a bid of 2NT.  <<<<<<<<<<<<< ASKING
We bid 2NT.
