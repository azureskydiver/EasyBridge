>>>>>>>>NORTH<<<<<<<<<<
S:Q876  H:97652  D:8  C:AQ5
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 8.0, Distn pts = 2.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 8.0.
  QT's = 1.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Likely Winners (2/1/0/2)
  8 Likely Losers (2/4/1/1)
Playing five-card majors, Hearts can be opened.
Preferred suits are  Hearts, Spades
The best suit is Hearts.
====================
West bids 3D.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
B00: We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 3 Hearts.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL5: Adding 3 point(s) for the 2 extra trump(s).
2REVAL38: (with 5-card Heart trump support & a singleton in Diamonds, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 8.0 to 14.0 points)
F01: Partner, opening in fourth position, is showing 10.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
I08: Have 8.0/8.0/14.0 points with 5-card support for partner's Hearts (holding 97652), which is too strong for a limit raise, so we have to temporarily shift to Spades with a bid of 3 Spades.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<???????????  4H better ????
We bid 3S.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 3 Spades.  Declarer is North; East leads.
