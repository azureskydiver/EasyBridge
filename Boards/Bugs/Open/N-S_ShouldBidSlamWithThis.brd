S:K82  H:AQ8  D:AK2  C:KQJ9
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 22.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;

====================
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
A00: Have 22.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
A40: This exceeds the max pts for a 2NT opening (21), but is less than min pts for 3NT (25).  So bid the lowest openable suit of 1 Club for now, then jump shift to NT later.
We bid 1C.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Club and partner's response of 1 Spade.
B3U00a: Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid after an earlier pass, Spades over Clubs, which shows 5.5-11.5 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL38: (with 3-card Spade trump support including a trump honor, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 22.0 to 23.0 points)
B3U76: With a balanced hand, approx. 27.5-33.5 HCPs in the partnership, and stoppers in all suits, we can make game at No Trumps, so bid 3 No Trump.
We bid 3NT.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 No Trump.  Declarer is North; East leads.
