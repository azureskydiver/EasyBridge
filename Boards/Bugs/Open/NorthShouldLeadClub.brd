=======================
PL03: Starting play as right-hand defender.

PLDF47: Partner's King can win the trick, so discard the D4.
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Diamonds.
PLDF47: Partner's Queen can win the trick, so discard the D6.
PLDF40a: Play higher with the Ace.
PLYLDRT2: We'd like to return partner's Clubs suit, but dummy will most likely win.
PLYLD44: With no other obvious plays, lead a low trump S2. <<<<<<<<<<<<< HAD 7 Clubs so South could be void
