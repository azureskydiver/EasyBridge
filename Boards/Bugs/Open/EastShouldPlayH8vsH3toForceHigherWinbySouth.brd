West leads H5, N plays H3, East hold HQ984 and he plays the H4 letting South win trick with H7. If is fine to not play his Q but he should have played the H8 to force a higher card - potentially.

======================
East analysis +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
S:KQ2  H:Q984  D:Q62  C:J76
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 10.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.5;
Total pts = 8.5.
  QT's = 1.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Likely Winners (2/2/1/0)
  8 Likely Losers (1/2/2/3)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 1S.
--------------------
North bids 2D.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Spade.
(with 3-card Spade trump support including a trump honor, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 8.5 to 10.5 points)
Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
Have 10.0/8.5/10.5 points (in between single & double raise ranges)  and moderate support for partner's Spade suit (holding KQ2), but first show our preferred Heart suit in a 2 Hearts bid.
We bid 2H.

Bidding finished; contract is 2 Hearts.  Declarer is East; South leads.

We have only 6 sure tricks against a requirement of 8 for the 2H contract.
The Club suit looks the most promising for further development.
Checking play sequencing...
We want to eventualy exit with a Club and a Spade.
Interleaving plays...
The tentative list of available plays is as follows:
------>
 Play 1: Cash the Queen of Clubs in dummy.
 Play 2: Cash the Ace of Clubs in dummy.
 Play 3: Cash the Queen of Spades in hand.
 Play 4: Cash the King of Spades in hand.
 Play 5: Cash the Jack of Spades in dummy.
 Play 6: Cash the Ace of Spades in dummy.
 Play 7: Exit with a Club or Spade and throw the opponents into the lead.
 Play 8: Ruff a Spade in hand.
 Play 9: Ruff a Club in hand.
 Play 10: Ruff a Diamond in dummy.
 Play 11: Lead a low Club from hand to finesse the Queen in dummy against North, with the Ace as cover.
 Play 12: Lead a low Club from dummy and finesse the Jack in hand against South.
 Play 13: Lead a low Diamond from dummy and finesse the Queen in hand against South.
The planning is complete.
---------------------------
Play low Diamond (the four) from dummy to opportunistically finesse the Queen in hand.
RHO has played a higher card (the King) than our intended finesse (the Queen), so skip the play.
No usable plays found for the current situation.
We can't beat North's King, so discard the D2.
Reviewing play plan for round 2...
We have only 6 reasonably sure tricks left vs. 8 more trick(s) required for the contract.
eight to winners.
Checking play sequencing...
We can fulfill the contract by pulling 2 round(s) of trumps, and cashing the SA, SK, SQ, SJ, CA and CQ.
Interleaving plays...
the card led (DA)  beats the DQ we were going to play, so skip the cash for now.
No usable plays found for the current situation.
Playing second in hand, using default player logic.
We don't have a winner in the suit in hand, so discard the six.
Playing card from dummy.
No usable plays found for the current situation.
Reviewing play plan for round 3...
We have only 6 reasonably sure tricks left vs. 8 more trick(s) required for the contract.
eight to winners.
Checking play sequencing...
We can fulfill the contract by pulling 2 round(s) of trumps, and cashing the SA, SK, SQ, SJ, CA and CQ.
Interleaving plays...
Discard a Club from hand in anticipation of cashing the Ace in dummy.
Playing card from dummy.
the opponents led a Club, so see if we can finish up the cash play here.
We can actually play the Queen to win this trick, so postpone the cash of the Ace.
No usable plays found for the current situation.
Playing card from dummy.
Reviewing play plan for round 4...
We have only 6 reasonably sure tricks left vs. 7 more trick(s) required for the contract.
Checking play sequencing...
We can fulfill the contract by pulling 2 round(s) of trumps, and cashing the SA, SK, SQ, SJ, CA and CJ.
Interleaving plays...
Lead the H5 up to own hand to pull in a round of trumps.
Although LHO may hold the trump Ace, we have nothing to beat it, so hope partner's five wins and discard the four.<<<======H8 better play
