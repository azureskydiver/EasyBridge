3REVAL8: Since the trump suit is only topped by a seven ...
??? the spade suit is 764 but has not been bid
North opened 1C, South bid 2C the North bids 2H with only 3???

Problem in play: West plays DQ over East's lead of DJ.
PLDF36: Partner's Jack is high or we can't beat the highest card,
so discard the DQ.  ??? Why the Q and not the 3
