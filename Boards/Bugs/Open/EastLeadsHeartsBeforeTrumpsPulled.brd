Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Have a strong suit in Clubs.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
E01: Have 14.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Club.
We bid 1C.
--------------------
South bids 1H.
--------------------
West bids 1S.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Club and partner's response of 1 Spade.
B3U00a: Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid after an earlier pass, Spades over Clubs, which shows 5.0-11.0 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL7: Adding 1 point(s) for the solid Club suit.
3REVAL6: Deducting 3 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
RevV0: We'd like to bid the Diamond suit, but we can't reverse with less than 17 points.
RevV2: And since the 3rd best suit (Spades) is not strong enough to bid, we have to rebid the original Club suit.
B3U18a: With poor support for partner's Spade suit (holding T), and no other suit available to bid, rebid the Club suit at 2 Clubs.
We bid 2C.

Bidding finished; contract is 2 Clubs.  Declarer is East; South leads.
