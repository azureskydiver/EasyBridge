>>>>>>> NORTH<<<<<<<
S:AJ853  H:3  D:AQ7  C:T542

Preferred suit is Spades.
====================
South bids 1C.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Club.
REVAL38: (with 4-card Club trump support & a singleton in Hearts, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 11.0 to 14.0 points)
F00: Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
F01a: Have 11.0/11.0/14.0 pts with an available 5-card major suit in Spades (AJ853), so bid 1 Spade over partner's minor suit 1 Club bid.
We bid 1S.
--------------------
East bids 2H.
--------------------
South bids 2NT.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Club, 1 Spade, and 2 No Trump.
NT42: Partner's jump shift from our 1 Spade bid to 2 No Trump indicates a balanced hand and 17.0+ points, for a total of 28.0+ points in the partnership, and is forcing to game.
BN1: With 28.0+ HCPs in the partnership and a reasonably balanced hand, though without stoppers in all suits, bid 3 No Trump.
We bid 3NT.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 No Trump.  Declarer is South; West leads.
