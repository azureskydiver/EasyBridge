Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Heart and partner's response of 3 Clubs.
B3Y00: Partner has made a jump shift to 3 Clubs after our opening 1 Heart bid, which indicates 18.0+ points and is forcing to game (and points to a possible slam).
B3Y43: With a total of 33.0-36.0 HCPs in the partnership, a reasonably balanced hand, and poor support for partner's suits, and no strong suit of our own, push towards a slam in notrumps with a bid of 3 No Trump.
