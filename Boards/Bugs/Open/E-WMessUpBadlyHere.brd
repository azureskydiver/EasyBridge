Rebidding after opening bid of Double and partner's response of 4 Spades.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<< SPADES is South's Suit??????????????????
TKORb40: Partner has responded in the enemy suit, indicating 13+ pts but no long suits.
TKRb49: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 25.0-34.0 pts.
TKRb80: Without clear suit agreement, and holding a blanaced hand, we want to steer towards a contract in No Trump.
TKRb81: But as we do not have a proper hand to bid No Trump at the appropriate level, we have to pass.
We pass.
