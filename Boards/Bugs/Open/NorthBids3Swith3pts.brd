Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Hearts.
REVAL38: (with 3-card Heart trump support, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 2.0 to 3.0 points)
ROVRC5: Partner overcalled at the 2-level, indicating a good 5+ card Heart suit, 9.0-14.0 points, and probably 6+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 12.0-17.0 points.
ROVRC10: This is not enough to bid any higher, so pass.
We pass.
