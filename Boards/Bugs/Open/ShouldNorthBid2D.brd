North should support South's diamonds vs 1NT ???
>>>>>>> NORTH<<<<<<<
S:A54  H:965  D:865  C:Q763
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 6.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 6.0.
  QT's = 1.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  3 Likely Winners (1/0/0/2)
  10 Likely Losers (2/3/3/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
Opening bid for team.
Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Diamond.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
F01: Partner, opening in third position, is showing 10.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
G60: We have 6.0/6.0/6.0 points with weak support for partner's minor Diamond suit (holding 865) which we prefer not to raise, and not enough strength for a 2/1 response to show our Club suit, so bid 1NT.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<< Why not 2D ???
We bid 1NT.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3NT.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Diamond, 1 No Trump, and 3 No Trump.
NT10: Partner's raise from our 1 No Trump to 3 No Trump indicates a balanced hand and 20.0-24.0 HCPs, for a total of 26.0+ HCPs in the partnership.
B4G40: With approx. 26.0-30.0 total HCPs in the partnership, sign off at game and pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 No Trump.  Declarer is North; East leads.
