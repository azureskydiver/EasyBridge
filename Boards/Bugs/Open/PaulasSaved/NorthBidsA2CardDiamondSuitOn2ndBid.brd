====================
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Have 17.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
But with an openable 5-card Spade suit, prefer to open in the major instead of in No Trump.
Have 17.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Spade.
We bid 1S.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Spade and partner's response of 2 Spades.
With a single raise, partner is showing 6.0-10.0 points and decent (3-4 card) support for our Spade suit.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
2REVAL16: (after re-evaluation for distribution, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 17.0 to 18.0 points)
Using the modified trick count, we have 6 playing tricks in hand and a total of 24.0-28.0 points in the partnership, so show the Diamond support suit in a bid of 3 Diamonds.
We bid 3D.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
Partner has bid yet another suit, Hearts.
Although partner bid Hearts, we prefer to return to his previous Spade suit.
Support partner's Spade suit with 5-card support and 24.0-28.0 total team pts by bidding 3 Spades.
We bid 3S.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 3 Spades.  Declarer is North; East leads.
