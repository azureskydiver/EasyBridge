Don't know why N (partnere) didn't raise my 1H bid... he bid 1NT implying that he didn't like my heart suit. I really should have had 5 hearts but bid my good 4 card heart suit..
===============
North analysis
S:952  H:A974  D:JT  C:K632
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 8.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 8.0.
  QT's = 1.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  4 Likely Winners (0/2/0/2)
  9 Likely Losers (3/2/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 1D.
--------------------
South bids 1H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Heart.
(with 4-card Heart trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Diamonds, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 8.0 to 11.0 points)
Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Heart suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
The total point count in the partnership is therefore 18.5-25.5 points.
With 15.5+ HCPs in the partnership and a reasonably balanced hand, though without stoppers in all suits, bid 1 No Trump.
We bid 1NT.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.

West passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 1 No Trump.  Declarer is North; East leads.
