Why didn't North bid his 5 card major (H) vs his 5 card club suit? He only had 9 hcp but more with distribution..
====================
S:JT  H:KT943  D:JT5  C:AJT32
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 9.0, Distn pts = 3.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 9.0.
  QT's = 1.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Likely Winners (0/2/0/3)
  8 Likely Losers (0/3/3/2)
Playing five-card majors, Hearts can be opened.
Preferred suits are  Clubs, Hearts
The best suit is Clubs.

Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.

2REVAL38: (with 3-card Diamond trump support including a trump honor & a void in Spades, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 9.0 to 13.0 points)
Partner, opening in third position, is showing 10.0-18.5 points and 2+ QT's.
I14: Have 9.0/9.0/13.0 points but we prefer to shift instead of raising a minor Diamond suit, so show our own Club suit by bidding 2 Clubs.  <<<<<<< NO HEARTS<<<<<
We bid 2C.

REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
2REVAL16: (after re-evaluation for distribution, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 9.0 to 12.0 points)
Partner made a single raise of our 2 Clubs bid to 3 Clubs, showing 12.0 -18.5 points and 3+ trump cards.
We have a total of approx. 24.0-30.5 in the partnership, but we do not have a rebiddable suit, nor do we have enough stoppers for a NT contract, so we have to sign off on partner's 3 Clubs bid.
We pass.

East passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 3 Clubs.  Declarer is North; East leads.
