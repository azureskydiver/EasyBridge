??? Why did North bit 2NT vs 4Spades??????///
=======================================
S:QJT8  H:6  D:QT82  C:T953
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 5.0, Distn pts = 2.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.0;
Total pts = 4.0.
  QT's = 0.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  2 Likely Winners (2/0/1/-1)
  11 Likely Losers (2/1/3/5)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suits are  Diamonds, Spades
The best suit is Spades.
====================
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Spades.
(with 4-card Spade trump support including a trump honor & a singleton in Hearts, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 4.0 to 9.0 points)
Partner made a strong 2-bid, showing a very good suit or two solid suits, 9+ playing tricks, and 4+ quick tricks.  We have to respond positively if interested in slam, or negatively otherwise.
But with only 0.0 QT's, we have to make the negative response of 2 No Trump to deny slam values.
We bid 2NT.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3NT.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 2 Spades, 2 No Trump, and 3 No Trump.
Partner's raise from our 2 No Trump to 3 No Trump indicates a balanced hand and 20.0-25.0 HCPs, for a total of 25.0+ HCPs in the partnership.
With approx. 25.0-30.0 total HCPs in the partnership, sign off at game and pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 No Trump.  Declarer is North; East leads.
