N bid 3 card spade suit after open with 1 heart
North analysis
S:AJ8  H:AK765  D:AJ4  C:32
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 17.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 17.0.
  QT's = 4.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Likely Winners (1/3/1/0)
  8 Likely Losers (2/2/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, Hearts can be opened.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Have 17.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
But with an openable 5-card Heart suit, prefer to open in the major instead of in No Trump.
Have 17.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Heart.
We bid 1H.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Heart and partner's response of 2 Hearts.
With a single raise, partner is showing 6.0-10.0 points and decent (3-4 card) support for our Heart suit.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
2REVAL16: (after re-evaluation for distribution, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 17.0 to 18.0 points)
Using the modified trick count, we have 6 playing tricks in hand and a total of 24.0-28.0 points in the partnership, so show the Spade support suit in a bid of 2 Spades.
We bid 2S.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
Partner has returned to our first suit, raising it to 3 Hearts.
With 24.0-28.0 points in the partnership and no aspirations for a higher contract, we sign off on partner's bid of 3 Hearts.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Hearts.  Declarer is North; East leads.
