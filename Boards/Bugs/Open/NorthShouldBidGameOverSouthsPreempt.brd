====================
South bids 3C.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 3 Clubs.
REVAL38: (with 3-card Club trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Spades, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 19.0 to 20.0 points)
SHUTR0: Partner made a preemptive 3 Clubs bid, showing a 7-card Club suit with no tricks outside the suit, and most likely 5.5-8.5 points.
SHUTR9: With 19.0/19.0/20.0 points in hand, for a total of 25.5-28.5 points in the partnership, holding KT7 in support of partner's Club suit, and with only 4.0 QTs and 7 likely winners, we have no real reason to bid anything, so just pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 3 Clubs.  Declarer is South; West leads.
