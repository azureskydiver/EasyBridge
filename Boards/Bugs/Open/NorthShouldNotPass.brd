====================

--------------------
South bids 1D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Diamond.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 6 point(s) for the 3 trump(s) short of 3.
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Diamond suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 17.0-24.0 points.
ROVRC99: We have insufficient strength for either a raise, suit shift, or NT bid, so pass.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< NO
We pass.

East passes.
