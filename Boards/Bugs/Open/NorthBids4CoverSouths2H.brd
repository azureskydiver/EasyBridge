Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Hearts.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
RWKT: Partner made a weak 2-bid, showing a a 6+ card suit with 5.0-10.0 points, less than 4 cards in the other major, no voids, and no more than one singleton.
RWKT40: We have 19.0/19.0/19.0 points, for a partnership total of 24.0-29.0 points, so we may be interested in a possible slam.
RWKT48: We don't have very good support for partner's Heart suit (holding A, and don't have the proper distribution for a NT response, so jump shift to 4 Clubs.  Slam possibilities may be explored later.  <<<< Pard has 6 hearts , we don't need support there
We bid 4C.
--------------------
East passes.

We pass.
