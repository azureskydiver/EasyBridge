East tried to double a Redouble
>>>>EAST<<<<<<<<<<<<<
S:6  H:AK52  D:AKQJ42  C:84
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 17.0, Distn pts = 4.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 18.0.
  QT's = 4.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  8 Likely Winners (0/2/6/0)
  5 Likely Losers (1/2/0/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Have a powerful suit in Diamonds.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
South bids 1S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCTK: With 17.0/18.0 points, the hand is too strong for a simple overcall, so start by doubling.
We bid Dbl.
--------------------
South redoubles.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of Double and partner's pass.
TKOUT: With 17.0/18.0 points and support for all unbid suits, bid a takeout doubleagain.
But our bid (Double) is too low vs. the last bid of of 1 Spade, so we have to pass.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< Can't double a redouble!!!
We pass.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 1 Spade (redoubled).  Declarer is South; West leads.
