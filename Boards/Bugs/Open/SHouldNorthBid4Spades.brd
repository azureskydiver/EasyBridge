--------------------

--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 3 Spades.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
4REVAL21: Adjusting by 1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Spade trump support including a trump honor, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 14.0 to 15.0 points)
SHUTR0: Partner made a preemptive 3 Spades bid, showing a 7-card Spade suit with no tricks outside the suit, and most likely 5.0-8.0 points.
SHUTR9: With 14.0/14.0/15.0 points in hand, for a total of 20.0-23.0 points in the partnership, holding KJ7 in support of partner's Spade suit, and with only 3.0 QTs and 2 likely winners, we have no real reason to bid anything, so just pass.
