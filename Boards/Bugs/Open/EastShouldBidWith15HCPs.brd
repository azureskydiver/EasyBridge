East should have bid with 15 HCPs
>>>>>>>EAST<<<
S:AK964  H:KQ  D:KT9  C:832
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 15.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 15.0.
  QT's = 3.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  3 Likely Winners (3/1/0/-1)
  10 Likely Losers (2/1/3/4)
Playing five-card majors, Spades can be opened.
Preferred suit is Spades.
====================
South bids 2D.
--------------------
West bids 2H.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Hearts.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
ROVRC5: Partner overcalled at the 2-level, indicating a good 5+ card Heart suit, 9.0-14.0 points, and probably 6+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 24.0-29.0 points.
ROVRC99: We have insufficient strength for either a raise, suit shift, or NT bid, so pass.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<???? South has weak hand ie West could have pts
We pass.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 Hearts.  Declarer is West; North leads.
=======================

RCP20: Dummy is now out of Hearts.
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Diamonds.
RCP5A: West is now known to have started with 2 Diamonds.
RCP5A: South is now known to have started with 1 Spade.
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Spades.
