Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 11.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.0;
Total pts = 10.0.
  QT's = 2.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  4 Likely Winners (2/0/0/2)
  9 Likely Losers (1/4/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
South bids 1S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Spade.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
Have 11.0/10.0/10.0 points  and moderate support for partner's Spade suit (holding KQ7), but first show our preferred Club suit in a 2 Clubs bid.
We bid 2C.
--------------------
East bids 2D.
--------------------
South bids 3C.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Spade, 2 Clubs, and 3 Clubs.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 5.
2REVAL18: Declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 10.0 down to 9.0 points)
Partner made a single raise of our 2 Clubs bid to 3 Clubs, showing 12.0 -21.0 points and 3+ trump cards.
We have a total of approx. 21.0-30.0 in the partnership, but we do not have a rebiddable suit, nor do we have enough stoppers for a NT contract, so we have to sign off on partner's 3 Clubs bid.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Clubs.  Declarer is North; East leads.
