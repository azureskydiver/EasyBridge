====================
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
E01: Have 13.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Club.
We bid 1C.
--------------------
East bids 1S.
--------------------
South bids 1NT.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Club and partner's response of 1 No Trump.
B3J00: With a 1NT response, partner is showing 9.0-11.0 points, a lack of good support for our Club suit, and no other suit available to bid at an appropriate level.
RevV0: We'd like to bid the Heart suit, but we can't reverse with less than 17 points.
RevV2: And since the 3rd best suit (Spades) is not strong enough to bid, we have to rebid the original Club suit.
B3K20: Partner doesn't like our Clubs, but with 13.0/13.0 points and no other good suit, jump rebid to 3 Clubs.  <<<<<<<<< Why JUMP ???
We bid 3C.

East passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 3 Clubs.  Declarer is North; East leads.
