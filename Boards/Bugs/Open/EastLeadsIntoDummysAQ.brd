East leads spade into DMY's TenAce (AQ)
>>>>>> EAST<<<<
S:J94  H:K7  D:J873  C:A965
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 9.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-0.5;
Total pts = 8.5.
  QT's = 1.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  4 Likely Winners (0/1/1/2)
  9 Likely Losers (3/1/3/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
Opening bid for team.
Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
South bids 1H.
--------------------
West bids 2S.
--------------------
North bids 2NT.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Spades.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Spade trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Hearts, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 8.5 to 9.0 points)
ROVRC3: Partner made a weak jump overcall of 2 Spades, indicating 5.0-9.0 pts and a good 6+ card Spade suit.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 14.0-18.0 points.
ROVRC20: This is insufficient to raise partner, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
South bids 3NT.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North bids 4H.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 4 Hearts.  Declarer is South; West leads.
=======================
PL03: Starting play as right-hand defender.
PLDF36: Partner's King is high or we can't beat the highest card, so discard the C5.
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Clubs.
PLDF40a: Play higher with the Ace.
PLYLDRT1: We'd like to return partner's Clubs suit, but dummy might ruff.
PLYLD33: Partner has bid the Spades suit, so lead the S4.   <<<<<<<<<<<< NOT INTO Dummy's AQ ?????????/
