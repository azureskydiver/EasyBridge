Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Diamonds.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL5: Adding 3 point(s) for the 2 extra trump(s).
2REVAL38: (with 5-card Diamond trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Clubs, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 6.0 to 11.0 points)
ROVRC5: Partner overcalled at the 2-level, indicating a good 5+ card Diamond suit, 9.0-14.0 points, and probably 6+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 20.0-25.0 points.
ROVRC99: We have insufficient strength for either a raise, suit shift, or NT bid, so pass.
We pass.

3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
PKF1: With 5 trumps in partner's first suit (Diamonds), we prefer to support that suit.   <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B4P10: With only 6.0/6.0 points in hand, for a total in the partnership of 12.0-18.0 points, we have to pass.
We pass.
