***Bidding restarted***
East bids 1C.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL6: But we don't have a sufficiently strong overcall suit.
TKOUT: With 20.0/20.0 points and support for all unbid suits, bid a takeout double.
We bid Dbl.

West bids 1D.

We bid Dbl.

Rebidding after opening bid of Double and partner's response of 2 Clubs.
TKORb43: Partner has made a minimum response of 2 Clubs, indicating no more than 9 points.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<NOTE
TKRb49: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 24.0-29.0 pts.
YN1: With 24.0-29.0 points in the partnership and 4-card support for partner's  Club suit (holding AQJ3), raise to 5 Clubs.
TKRb71b: We can assume partner has some strength in the Club suit, so we can shade the requirements slightly.
