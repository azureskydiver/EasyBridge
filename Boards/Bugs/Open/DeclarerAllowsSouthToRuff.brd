Opening bid for team.
TKOTR: Partner has doubled for takeout.
TKORT8: Partner's takeout indicates 11.0+ HCPs, for a total in the partnership of 20.0-30.0 points.
TKOTR12: But Right-hand opponent has bid after partner's double, so the takeout is no longer in effect.
TKOTR14: However, assuming partner has 12+ HCPs, that amount combined with our 10.0/9.0 points totals 22.0/21.0 pts, which is enough for us to bid 1 Spade.
We bid 1S.

North passes.
