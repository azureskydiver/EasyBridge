North bids 4Clubs vs supporting South's Spades?
>>>>>>>> NORTH<<<<<<<
S:K9532  H:7  D:A85  C:K863
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 10.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 10.0.
  QT's = 2.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  6 Likely Winners (3/0/1/2)
  7 Likely Losers (2/1/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, Spades can be opened.
Preferred suit is Spades.
====================
South bids 2H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Hearts.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
RWKT: Partner made a weak 2-bid, showing a a 6+ card suit with 5.5-10.5 points, less than 4 cards in the other major, no voids, and no more than one singleton.
RWKT4: We only have 10.0/10.0/10.0 points, for a partnership total of 15.5-20.5 points, which is probably not enough for game.
RWKT10: And since we don't like partner's Heart suit (holding 7), have no good suit of our own, and hold an imbalanced hand, we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East doubles.
--------------------
South bids 2S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 2 Hearts, Pass, and 2 Spades.
B4Z00: Partner made a response which we don't understand; simply pass.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<???????????
We pass.
--------------------
East doubles.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 3D.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's  bid of 3 Spades.
REVAL38: (with 5-card Spade trump support including a trump honor & a singleton in Hearts, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 10.0 to 17.0 points)
F00: Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
I08: Have 10.0/10.0/17.0 points with 5-card support for partner's Spades (holding K9532), which is too strong for a limit raise, so we have to temporarily shift to Clubs with a bid of 4 Clubs.
We bid 4C.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<???????????????
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 4 Clubs.  Declarer is North; East leads.
