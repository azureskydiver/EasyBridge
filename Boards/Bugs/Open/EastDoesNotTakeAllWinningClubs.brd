3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
F00: Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
G64: We have 8.0/7.5/7.5 points with poor support for partner's Spade suit (holding J4) and not enough strength for a 2/1 response to show our Club suit, so bid 1NT.
We bid 1NT.

South bids 2H.
--------------------
West bids 3H.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Spade, 1 No Trump, and 3 Hearts.
PKF7: Since our first suit is not rebiddable, and we lack good support for either of partner's suits, we prefer to bid a new suit inClubs.
B4Q02: Partner made a jump shift to 3 Hearts in response to our 1 No Trump bid, showing 19.0-22.0 points.  The bid is forcing to game.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...

BN1: With 27.0+ HCPs in the partnership and a reasonably balanced hand, and all unbid suits stopped, bid 3 No Trump.
