  HCPs = 9.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;

  QT's = 2.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Likely Winners (3/2/0/0)
  8 Likely Losers (1/2/3/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suits are  Hearts, Spades
The best suit is Spades.
====================
East bids 3C.
--------------------
South bids 3H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 3 Hearts.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL5: Adding 1 point(s) for the 1 extra trump(s).
2REVAL38: (with 4-card Heart trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Clubs, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 9.0 to 12.0 points)
F00: Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
I08: Have 9.0/9.0/12.0 points with 4-card support for partner's Hearts (holding AT93), which is too strong for a limit raise, so we have to temporarily shift to Spades with a bid of 3 Spades.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<< NO GO TO GAME !!!!!!!!!!
We bid 3S.
