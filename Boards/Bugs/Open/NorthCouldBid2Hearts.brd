S:AT7  H:T952  D:T5  C:KT65
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 7.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 7.0.
  QT's = 1.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  3 Likely Winners (1/0/0/2)
  10 Likely Losers (2/4/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 1C.
--------------------
South bids 1H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Heart.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL5: Adding 1 point(s) for the 1 extra trump(s).
2REVAL38: (with 4-card Heart trump support & a doubleton in Diamonds, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 7.0 to 9.0 points)
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Heart suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 16.0-23.0 points.
ROVRC99: We have insufficient strength for either a raise, suit shift, or NT bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 1 Heart.  Declarer is South; West leads.
