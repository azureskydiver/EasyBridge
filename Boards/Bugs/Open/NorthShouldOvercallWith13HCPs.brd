>>>>>>>>>>>>>> NORHT<<<<<<<
S:KJ96  H:J9  D:QT9  C:KQJ9
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 13.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.5;
Total pts = 11.5.
  QT's = 1.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  6 Likely Winners (2/0/1/3)
  7 Likely Losers (2/2/2/1)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suits are  Clubs, Spades
The best suit is Clubs.
====================
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 1D.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL6: But we don't have a sufficiently strong overcall suit.
B00: We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<????????????? 2C or 1S
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's  bid of 1 Heart.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Heart suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 18.5-25.5 points.
BN1: With 20.0+ HCPs in the partnership and a reasonably balanced hand, though without stoppers in all suits, bid 1 No Trump.
We bid 1NT.
--------------------
East passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 1 No Trump.  Declarer is North; East leads.
