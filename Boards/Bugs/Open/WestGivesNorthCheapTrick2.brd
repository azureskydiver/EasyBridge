Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 8.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-0.5;
Total pts = 7.5.
  QT's = 1.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  4 Likely Winners (0/1/3/0)
  9 Likely Losers (2/2/2/3)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
Opening bid for team.
Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North bids 1C.
--------------------
East bids 1H.
--------------------
South bids 2C.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Heart.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Heart trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Spades, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 7.5 to 9.5 points)
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Heart suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 16.5-23.5 points.
BN1: With 15.0+ HCPs in the partnership and a reasonably balanced hand, though without stoppers in all suits, bid 1 No Trump.
But our bid (1 No Trump) is too low vs. the last bid of of 2 Clubs, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 Clubs.  Declarer is North; East leads.
=======================
PL03: Starting play as right-hand defender.
PLDIS12: We do not have a winner in the Heart suit, so discard low with the three.
PLDF36: Partner's seven is high or we can't beat the highest card, so discard the H3.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<TOO LOW!!!!!!!!!!
