====================
West bids 1S.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL3: But we lack the strength with 12.0 pts for a simple overcall.
TKOUT: With 12.0/12.0 points and support for all unbid suits, bid a takeout double.
We bid Dbl.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of Double and partner's response of 2 Spades.
TKORb40: Partner has responded in the enemy suit, indicating 13+ pts but no long suits.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PTS OK 
TKRb49: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 25.0-34.0 pts.
TKRb81: But as we do not have a proper hand to bid No Trump at the appropriate level, we have to pass.  <<<<<<<<<<<<< ??? NO
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 Spades.  Declarer is South; West leads.
