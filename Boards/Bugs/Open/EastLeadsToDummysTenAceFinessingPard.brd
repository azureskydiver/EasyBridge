Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 11.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 11.0.
  QT's = 2.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  7 Likely Winners (0/1/4/2)
  6 Likely Losers (0/3/1/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
PL03: Starting play as right-hand defender.
PLDF40: Play high with the King.
PLYLDRT2: We'd like to return partner's Clubs suit, but dummy will most likely win.
PLCSW9: With no other good options, cash a winner in the Diamond suit, the Ace
PLYLD42: With no good card to lead, lead the HJ since the opponents have not shown out of the Heart suit.
