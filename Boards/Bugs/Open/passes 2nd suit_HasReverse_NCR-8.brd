Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Diamond and partner's response of 1 Heart.
Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid, Hearts over Diamonds, which shows 5.5-17.5 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
With poor support for partner's Heart suit (holding Q6), and a second openable suit in Clubs (holding 98653), show it in a 2 Clubs bid.
We bid 2C.

East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2S.

West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
