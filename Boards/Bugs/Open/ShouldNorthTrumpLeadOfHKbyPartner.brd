====================
South bids 1C.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North bids 1S.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
But we lack the strength with 6.0 pts for a simple overcall.
We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
South bids 2C.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 Clubs.  Declarer is South; West leads.
=======================
Starting play as right-hand defender.
With no cards in Hearts, trump with the C2.
East is now known to have started with 0 Hearts.
