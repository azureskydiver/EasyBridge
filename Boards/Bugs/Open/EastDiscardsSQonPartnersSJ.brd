S:AQ42  H:T72  D:J9  C:QJ96
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 10.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-0.5;
Total pts = 9.5.
  QT's = 1.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Likely Winners (3/0/0/2)
  8 Likely Losers (1/3/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Spades.
====================
West bids 1C.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Club.
REVAL38: (with 4-card Club trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Diamonds, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 9.5 to 12.5 points)
F00: Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
I14: Have 10.0/9.5/12.5 points but we prefer to shift instead of raising a minor Club suit, so show our own Spade suit by bidding 1 Spade.
We bid 1S.
--------------------
South bids 2D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Spade and partner's pass.
B3A20: Partner passed, showing < 6 points, so with 10.0/9.5 points in hand and 9.5-14.5 total partnership points, we have no choice but to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 Diamonds.  Declarer is South; West leads.
=======================
PL03: Starting play as right-hand defender.
PLDF36: Partner's Jack is high or we can't beat the highest card, so discard the SQ.  <<<<<<<< NO
