==================================================================
E analysis:

S:93  H:A9876  D:T6  C:8543
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 4.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 4.0.
  QT's = 1.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: H
  Probable Stoppers in:
  3 Likely Winners (0/3/0/0)
  10 Likely Losers (2/2/2/4)
Playing five-card majors, Hearts can be opened.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
Opening bid for team.
Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
South bids 1S.
--------------------
West bids 1NT.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 No Trump.
Partner's bid indicates 15-17 points with balanced hand.
Responding with a reasonably balanced hand and 4.0 HCP's, for a total in partnership of 19.0-21.0 HCPs.
We do not have quite enough for game even if partner has max opening points, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
South bids 2S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 Spades.  Declarer is South; West leads.
=======================
Starting play as right-hand defender.
We do not have a winner in the Diamond suit, so discard low with the ten.
Partner's King can win the trick, so discard the DT.
Play our only card in the suit, the six.
With no cards in Diamonds, trump with the S3.
East is now known to have started with 2 Diamonds.
With no other good options, cash a winner in the Heart suit, the Ace
With no other obvious plays, cash a winner with the HA.
South is now known to have started with 0 Hearts.
Partner discarded high with the ten, so consider it a suit preference signal.
Play the nine to win the trick.
Partner likes the Heart suit, but declarer has shown out of the suit and _may_ be able to ruff, so avoid leading the suit if possible.
With no other clear plays available, lead a card from the unbid Heart suit.
