  QT's = 1.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S
  Probable Stoppers in:
  2 Likely Winners (2/0/0/0)
  11 Likely Losers (2/2/4/3)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Spades.
====================

--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.

Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Heart.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
F01: Partner, opening in fourth position, is showing 10.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
G3: Have 5.0/5.0/5.0 points with poor (97) support for partner's Heart suit but hold a openable 4-card Spade suit, so bid 1 Spade instead.
We bid 1S.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 3D.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Heart, 1 Spade, and 3 Diamonds.
PKF2: With 4 trumps in partner's second suit (Diamonds), we prefer to support that suit.
B4Q02: Partner made a jump shift to 3 Diamonds in response to our 1 Spade bid, showing 19.0-22.0 points.  The bid is forcing to game.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL5: Adding 1 point(s) for the 1 extra trump(s).
2REVAL38: (with 4-card Diamond trump support & a doubleton in Hearts, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 5.0 to 7.0 points)
B4Q30: With 5.0/5.0 points and 4-card support for partner's second suit (Diamonds, holding T832), we can raise to 4 Diamonds.  <<<<<<<<<<NO!!!!!!!!
We bid 4D.

North passes.
--------------------
East bids 5D.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 4.
BXM81: We've reached agreement in suits, but with only 26.0-29.0 total points we can't raise partner's 5 Diamonds bid any further, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 5 Diamonds.  Declarer is East; South leads.
=======================
