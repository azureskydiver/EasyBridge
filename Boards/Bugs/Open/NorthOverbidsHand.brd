North can't bid 5D with only 9 HCPs
>>>>>>>>>>> NORTH<<<<<<
S:KJ95  H:  D:J7542  C:A743
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 9.0, Distn pts = 3.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 9.0.
  QT's = 1.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Likely Winners (2/0/2/1)
  8 Likely Losers (2/0/3/3)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suits are  Clubs, Spades
The best suit is Diamonds.
====================
South bids 1H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Heart.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 6 point(s) for the 3 trump(s) short of 3.
F00: Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
G3: Have 9.0/9.0/9.0 points with poor (void) support for partner's Heart suit but hold a openable 4-card Spade suit, so bid 1 Spade instead.
We bid 1S.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Heart, 1 Spade, and 2 Diamonds.
B4P04: Partner bid another suit (third suit in partnership) at 2 Diamonds after our 1/1 response, showing 12.0-18.0 points.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL5: Adding 3 point(s) for the 2 extra trump(s).
2REVAL38: (with 5-card Diamond trump support including a trump honor & a void in Hearts, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 9.0 to 18.0 points)
PKF2: With 5 trumps in partner's second suit (Diamonds), we prefer to support that suit.
YN1: With 30.0-36.0 points in the partnership and 5-card support for partner's  Diamond suit (holding J7542), raise to 4 Diamonds.
We bid 4D.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 4H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
3REVAL8: Since the trump suit is only topped by a King, deduct 2 points.
2REVAL16: (after re-evaluation for distribution, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 9.0 to 10.0 points)
CUR0: Partner made a cue bid of 4 Hearts, hinting at slam prospects.
CUR4: But we don't have the points (only 22.0-28.0 pts in the partnership) or the excellent trump support needed for a marginal slam, so we decline by returning to the agreed suit at a bid of 5 Diamonds.
We bid 5D. <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<????????
