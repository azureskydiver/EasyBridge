Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL6: But we don't have a sufficiently strong overcall suit.
TKOUT: With 11.0/10.5 points and support for all unbid suits, bid a takeout double.
We bid Dbl.

Rebidding after opening bid of Double and partner's response of 2 Clubs.
TKORb43: Partner has made a minimum response of 2 Clubs, indicating no more than 9 points.  <<<<<<<<<<<< No. East make cue bid. See above 
TKRb49: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 14.5-19.5 pts.
TKORb99: We see no good fit with partner and no other options, so pass.
We pass.
