PLDC2C2: We have no more cards in the suit in dummy, so discard the C7.
PLDYE52A: With no card left in the suit led, we discard the CJ.

No the Clubs are all winners,(dummy has KQJ5, declr haS AT76, should discard a Diamond because the K is missing. Has top 3 Spades, top 4 clubs and top Diamond = 8 tricks. Will lose two more heart tricks being lead from East.
