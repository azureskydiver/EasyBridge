North should overcall South's 3D  with 20 HCPs
>>>>>>NORTH<<<<<<<
S:AKQ  H:AJT872  D:AQ  C:93
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 20.0, Distn pts = 3.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 21.0.
  QT's = 4.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  8 Likely Winners (3/4/1/0)
  5 Likely Losers (0/2/1/2)
Playing five-card majors, Hearts can be opened.
Have a strong suit in Hearts.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
South bids 3D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 3 Diamonds.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
SHUTR0: Partner made a preemptive 3 Diamonds bid, showing a 7-card Diamond suit with no tricks outside the suit, and most likely 5.0-8.0 points.
SHUTR9: With 20.0/21.0/21.0 points in hand, for a total of 26.0-29.0 points in the partnership, holding AQ in support of partner's Diamond suit, and with only 4.5 QTs and 8 likely winners, we have no real reason to bid anything, so just pass.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< NO BID!!! have 6 Hearts
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Diamonds.  Declarer is South; West leads.
