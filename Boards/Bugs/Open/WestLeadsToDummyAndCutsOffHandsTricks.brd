West leads low Heart to Dummy with NO way back to hand which has 4 winning tricks in Hearts???
Also CJ in dummy is a winner that should have been taked before
>>>>>>>>>> WEST <<<<<<<<<,
S:T  H:AK8762  D:QJ5  C:AK8
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 17.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 18.0.
  QT's = 4.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  8 Likely Winners (0/5/1/2)
  5 Likely Losers (1/1/2/1)
Playing five-card majors, Hearts can be opened.
Have a strong suit in Hearts.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
Opening bid for team.
E01: Have 17.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Heart.
We bid 1H.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 1S.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Heart and partner's response of 1 Spade.
B3U00: Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid, Spades over Hearts, which shows 5.5-17.5 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
B3U69: With 1-card support for partner's Spades (holding T), 17.0/18.0/18.0 points, an unbalanced hand, our primary Heart suit not jump rebiddable, and no second suit available, bid 2NT.
We bid 2NT.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 3NT.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
BXPNT5: With a total of 22.5-34.5 / 23.5-35.5 pts in the partnership, we lack adequate strength for a further raise beyond partner's 3 No Trump bid, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 No Trump.  Declarer is West; North leads.
