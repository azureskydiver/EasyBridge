Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Club and partner's response of 1 Spade.
B3U00: Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid, Spades over Clubs, which shows 5.0-17.0 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Spade trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Hearts, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 10.5 to 12.5 points)
B3U14: With decent 3-card support for partner's major Spade suit (holding A97), no rebiddable suit, and no openable second suit, raise to 2 Spades.
We bid 2S.
