>>>>>>>> WEST<<<<<<<
S:AQJ932  H:T6  D:J2  C:964

  QT's = 1.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S

Have a strong suit in Spades.
Preferred suit is Spades.
====================
Opening bid for team.
WEAK2: Have a good 6-card Spade suit with 8.0/8.5 points (less than normal opening requirements), so bid a weak 2 Spades.
We bid 2S.
--------------------
North passes.

East bids 3H.
--------------------
South bids 4C.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 2 Spades and partner's response of 3 Hearts.
HRW2: Partner responded to our weak 2 Spades opening by shifting to Hearts which is forcing for one round, and asks for a raise with 3-card trump support or a doubleton honor.
HRWT14: But without adequate support for partner's Hearts (holding T6), and with 8.0/8.5 points in hand, we have to rebid our own Spades suit at 4 Spades.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< NO PASS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
We bid 4S.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South doubles.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 4 Spades and partner's pass.
B3A20: Partner passed, showing < 6 points, so with 8.0/8.5 points in hand and 8.5-13.5 total partnership points, we have no choice but to pass.
We pass.
