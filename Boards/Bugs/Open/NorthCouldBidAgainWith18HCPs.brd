***Bidding restarted***
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
A00: Have 18.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
A10: This exceeds the max pts for a 1NT opening (17), but is less than min pts for 2NT (20).  So bid the lowest openable suit of 1 Club for now, then try for a jump shift to 2NT later.
We bid 1C.
--------------------
East bids 1S.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Club and partner's pass.
B3A20: Partner passed, showing < 6 points, so with 18.0/18.0 points in hand and 18.0-27.0 total partnership points, we have no choice but to pass.  <<<<<<<< NO Freebid is 10 HCPs
We pass.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 1 Spade.  Declarer is East; South leads.
