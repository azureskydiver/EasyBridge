***Bidding restarted***

South doubles.
--------------------
West bids 2D.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 2 Clubs and partner's response of 2 Diamonds.
CRB0: After our strong 2 Club opening, partner's 2 Diamond bid is a negative response, denying slam values (less than 1 Quick Trick).
CRB8: Show our strongest suit (Diamonds) with a bid of 3 Diamonds.   <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< ??? Have only 3
We bid 3D.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 5D.

--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
CRB80: Partner raised our Diamond suit, which is strange, but since we're at game, stop here and pass.
We pass.
