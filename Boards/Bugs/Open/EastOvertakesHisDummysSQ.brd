Opening bid for team.
A00: Have 19.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
A10: This exceeds the max pts for a 1NT opening (17), but is less than min pts for 2NT (20).  So bid the lowest openable suit of 1 Diamond for now, then try for a jump shift to 2NT later.
We bid 1D.

PLNADJ: Reviewing play plan for round 2...
PLRV11: We have 8 reasonably sure tricks left vs. 8 more trick(s) required for the contract.
PLSEQ: Checking play sequencing...
