South bids 1D.
--------------------
West bids 1S.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Diamond.
(with 4-card Diamond trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Spades, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 9.0 to 12.0 points)
Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
Have 9.0/9.0/12.0 points, but can't support partner's Diamond suit at even the 2-level (holding KJT9), and have only weak suits of our own, so give up and bid 1NT.
We bid 1NT.

East bids 2S.
--------------------
South bids 3D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Diamond, 1 No Trump, and 3 Diamonds.

with a total of 24.0-28.0 pts in the partnership, Pass.
We pass.

East passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 3 Diamonds.  Declarer is South; West leads.
