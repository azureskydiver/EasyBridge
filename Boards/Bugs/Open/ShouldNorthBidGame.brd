--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCTK: With 17.0/17.0 points, the hand is too strong for a simple overcall, so start by doubling.
We bid Dbl.
--------------------
East passes.

South bids 3C.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< NOTE
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of Double and partner's response of 3 Clubs.
TKORb42: Partner has made a jump/freebid response of 3 Clubs, indicating 10-12 pts and a 4-5 card suit.
TKRb49: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 27.0-29.0 pts.  <<<<<<<<<<<<????
TKRb81: But as we do not have a proper hand to bid No Trump at the appropriate level, we have to pass.
We pass.
