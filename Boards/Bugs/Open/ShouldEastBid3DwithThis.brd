***Bidding restarted***
West bids 2S.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Spades.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
RWKT: Partner made a weak 2-bid, showing a a 6+ card suit with 5.0-10.0 points, less than 4 cards in the other major, no voids, and no more than one singleton.
RWKT4: We only have 6.0/9.0/6.0 points, for a partnership total of 11.0-16.0 points, which is probably not enough for game.
RWKT8: And we don't like partner's Spade suit (holding 8), so shift to our preferred Diamond suit in a bid of 3 Diamonds.   <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<????????? 
We bid 3D.
