Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 1C.
--------------------
South bids 1D.
--------------------
West bids 1H.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Diamond.
REVAL38: (with 4-card Diamond trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Hearts,  & a singleton in Clubs, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 8.0 to 14.0 points)
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Diamond suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 21.0-28.0 points.
YN1: With 21.0-28.0 points in the partnership and 4-card support for partner's  Diamond suit (holding KT53), raise to 3 Diamonds.
We bid 3D.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 5D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Diamond, 3 Diamonds, and 5 Diamonds.
B4M00: Partner made a double raise of our Diamond suit to 5 Diamonds, showing 17.0-21.0 points.
BLKWDx: we'd like to use Blackwood, but partner has already bid higher than 4NT, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 5 Diamonds.  Declarer is South; West leads.
