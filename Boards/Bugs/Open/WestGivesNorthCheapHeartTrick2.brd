>>>>>>>>>> WEST<<<<<<<<<<
S:A2  H:J83  D:Q876  C:T642
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 7.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-0.5;
Total pts = 6.5.
  QT's = 1.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  1 Likely Winners (1/0/1/-1)
  12 Likely Losers (1/3/3/5)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
Opening bid for team.
Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North bids 1S.
--------------------
East bids 2D.
--------------------
South bids 2H.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Diamonds.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL5: Adding 1 point(s) for the 1 extra trump(s).
4REVAL21: Adjusting by 1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 4-card Diamond trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Spades, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 6.5 to 9.5 points)
ROVRC5: Partner overcalled at the 2-level, indicating a good 5+ card Diamond suit, 9.0-14.0 points, and probably 6+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 18.5-23.5 points.
ROVRC99: We have insufficient strength for either a raise, suit shift, or NT bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North bids 2S.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 Spades.  Declarer is North; East leads.
=======================
PL03: Starting play as right-hand defender.
PLDIS12: We do not have a winner in the Diamond suit, so discard low with the eight.
PLDF47: Partner's King can win the trick, so discard the D8.
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Diamonds.
PLDF47: Partner's Ace can win the trick, so discard the D6.
PLDIS12: We do not have a winner in the Heart suit, so discard low with the eight.
PLDF36: Partner's nine is high or we can't beat the highest card, so discard the H8.   <<<<<<<<< Let' North's HT win
PLDF36: Partner's nine is high or we can't beat the highest card, so discard the H3.
