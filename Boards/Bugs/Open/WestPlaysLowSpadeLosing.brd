East bids 1D.
--------------------
South bids 2C.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Diamond.
REVAL38: (with 4-card Diamond trump support & a singleton in Clubs, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 8.0 to 13.0 points)
F01: Partner, opening in third position, is showing 10.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
I08: Have 9.0/8.0/13.0 points with 4-card support for partner's Diamonds (holding T965), which is too strong for a limit raise, so we have to temporarily shift to Spades with a bid of 2 Spades.
--------------------

South doubles.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Diamond, 2 Spades, and 4 Spades.

B4M20: With 9.0/8.0/8.0 points in hand, for a total in partnership of 23.0-29.0 points, sign off at partner's bid of 4 Spades.
We pass.
