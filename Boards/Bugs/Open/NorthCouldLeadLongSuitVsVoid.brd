====================
West bids 1S.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL3: But we lack the strength for a simple overcall.
B00: We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 2D.
--------------------
South bids 2H.
--------------------
West bids 2S.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Hearts.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
ROVRC5: Partner overcalled at the 2-level, indicating a good 5+ card Heart suit, 9.0-14.0 points, and probably 6+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 11.5-16.5 points.
ROVRC10: This is not enough to bid any higher, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 4S.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 4 Spades.  Declarer is West; North leads.
=======================
PL02: Starting play as left-hand defender.
PLYLEAD: Making opening lead as North against a contract of 4 Spades.
PLYLD4: Lead the singleton C7.
