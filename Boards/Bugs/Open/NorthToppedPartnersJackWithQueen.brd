[[File Comments]]
PLDF38C: we top declarer's Jack with the Queen to force dummy to play a winner.
The Jack was led by player's partner(South) and North covered with a Queen. 
Problem: it was partner NOT declarer that led Jack.
North should duck.
PLDFP10: ...
East leads SA when partner has singleton K
