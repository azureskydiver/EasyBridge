=======================
PL02: Starting play as left-hand defender.
PLYLEAD: Making opening lead as East against a contract of 3 Spades.
PLYLD15: Lead the CJ from the top of the { CJ CT } sequence.
PLYSIG1: Partner discarded low with the two, so consider it a signal that he dislikes the suit.
PLAYDF2: Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
PLDF2E1: North led an honor (the Jack), we may be being finessed, so play seven.
PLAYDF2: Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
PLDF2H2: As second hand, play the lowest card we have in the suit, the ten.
RCP5A: West is now known to have started with 2 Spades.
PLAYB48: We can't beat South's Ace, so discard the SK.
PLAYB48: We can't beat North's King, so discard the D5.

PLDF2H1: Play second hand low with the six.
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Clubs.
PLAYDF2: Playing second as defender, using default player logic.

PLAYB41: Play the ten to win the trick.
PLCSW9: With no other good options, cash a winner in the Heart suit, the Ace
PLYLD43: With no good card to lead, lead the D7 since dummy is not void in the Diamond suit (we don't know about declarer, though).
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Diamonds.
PLDF38A: Playing third ahead of dummy, we need to beat dummy's Jack, so play the Ace.
PLYLDRT8: Return partner's Heart suit with the two. <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< NO HT better
