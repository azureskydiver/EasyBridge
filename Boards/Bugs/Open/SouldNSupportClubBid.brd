====================
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Have 13.0 points in high cards and 2.5 quick tricks, so bid 1 Club.
We bid 1C.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2C.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Club and partner's response of 2 Clubs.
With a single raise, partner is showing 6.0-10.0 points and decent (3-4 card) support for our Club suit.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
2REVAL16: (after re-evaluation for distribution, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 13.0 to 16.0 points)
Using the modified trick count, we have 6 playing tricks in hand and a total of 22.0-26.0 points in the partnership, so show the Spade support suit in a bid of 2 Spades.
We bid 2S.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3C.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
Partner returned to our agreed Club at a bid of 3 Clubs after we showed the Spade side suit.
With a total of 22.0-26.0 partnership points, we don't have the strength to bid game, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Clubs.  Declarer is North; East leads.
