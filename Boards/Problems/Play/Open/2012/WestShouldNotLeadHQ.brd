We have only 6 sure tricks against a requirement of 9 for the 3S contract.
The Heart suit looks the most promising for further development.
Checking play sequencing...
Interleaving plays...
The tentative list of available plays is as follows:
------>
 Play 1: Opportunistically play the ten from dummy to finesse against South.
 Play 2: Play the DA from Dummy to try and drop the DJ.
 Play 3: Ruff a Heart in hand.
 Play 4: Ruff a Diamond in hand.
 Play 5: Ruff a Diamond in hand.
 Play 6: Ruff a Club in dummy.
 Play 7: Ruff a Club in dummy.
 Play 8: Lead a low Heart from hand to finesse the Jack in dummy against North, with the Ace as cover.
 Play 9: Lead a low Heart from hand to finesse the Queen in dummy against North, with the Ace as cover.
 Play 10: Lead the Heart ten from hand and finesse it, with the Ace in dummy as cover.
 Play 11: Lead a low Diamond from hand to finesse the ten in dummy against North, with the { DA DK DQ  } as possible cover cards.
 Play 12: Cash the Ace of Diamonds in dummy.
 Play 13: Cash the King of Diamonds in dummy.
 Play 14: Cash the Queen of Diamonds in dummy.
 Play 15: Cash the Ace of Hearts in dummy.
 Play 16: Cash the Queen of Hearts in dummy.
 Play 17: Cash the Jack of Hearts in dummy.
The planning is complete.
---------------------------
Opportunistically finesse the DT from dummy in second position against North.
The finesse failed, so abandon the play
No usable plays found for the current situation.
We can't beat North's Jack, so discard the D4.

  Probable Stoppers in:
  3 Sure Winners (0/1/2/0)
  5 Eventual Winners (0/3/2/0)
  8 Possible Losers (vs. 4 allowable)
Playing card from dummy.
Reviewing play plan for round 2...
We have only 4 reasonably sure tricks left vs. 8 more trick(s) required for the contract.
The Heart suit looks the most promising for further development.
Checking play sequencing...
We want to work on developing the Heart suit first, so move its plays up to the front if possible.
Interleaving plays...
Play the HQ from dummy to force out the opponents' King.
We're in the opposite hand of a force play, so discard the H4.
