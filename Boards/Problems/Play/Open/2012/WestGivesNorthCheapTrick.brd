Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 9.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0; Total pts = 9.0.
  QT's = 1.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H
  Probable Stoppers in:
  1 Likely Winners (0/2/-1/0)
  12 Likely Losers (3/2/4/3)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
North bids 3S.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL3: But we lack the strength with 9.0 pts for a simple overcall.
B00: We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Spades.  Declarer is North; East leads.
=======================
RCP25: Dummy is shown to be void in Spades.
PL03: Starting play as right-hand defender.
PLDIS12: We do not have a winner in the Diamond suit, so discard low with the three.
PLDF47: Partner's DQ can win the trick, so discard the D3.
PLAYB41: Play the Ace to win the trick.
PLYLDRT2: We'd like to return partner's Diamonds suit, but dummy will most likely win.
PLYLD38: Return partner's openning lead by leading the D5.
PLAYDF2: Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
PLDF2A: Play our only card in the suit, the four.
RCP5A: North is now known to have started with 2 Diamonds.
PLAYB48: We can't beat North's King, so discard the S7.
PLDIS2: Since we can win the next round of Hearts, we want to signal by discarding high in the suit.
PLDIS8: Begin the high-low signal with the six.
PLDF36: Partner's three is high or we can't beat the highest card, so discard the H2. <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<????
