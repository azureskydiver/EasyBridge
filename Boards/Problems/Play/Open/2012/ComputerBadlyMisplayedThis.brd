 Play 3: Lead a low Heart from hand to finesse the ten in dummy against West, with the Ace as cover.
 Play 4: Lead a low Heart from hand to finesse the Jack in dummy against West, with the Ace as cover.
 Play 5: Cash the Ace of Spades in hand.
 Play 6: Cash the Ace of Clubs in dummy.
 Play 7: Cash the King of Clubs in hand.
 Play 8: Cash the Ace of Diamonds in hand.
