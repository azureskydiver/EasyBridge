---------------------------
PLRUF13: Can't ruff Club in hand, hand is not void.
PL2FNS20: Can't use this (Type II) finesse leading from dummy, as the finesse card (CJ) has to be led from hand.
PL3FN22: Lead a low Club (the three) from dummy to finesse the Jack in hand.  ?????????????????????????<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
PLAY: East leads the C3.
PLAY: South plays the CQ.
PL3FN62: RHO has played a higher card (the Queen) than our intended finesse (the Jack), so play low with the ten.
PLAY: We play the CT.
PLAY: North plays the C2.
PLAY: South wins the round.
