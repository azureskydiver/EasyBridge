Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 5.0, Distn pts = 3.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.0; Total pts = 4.0.
  QT's = 0.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  2 Likely Winners (-1/0/0/3)
  11 Likely Losers (5/3/0/3)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
Opening bid for team.
Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 1S.
--------------------
South bids 2H.
--------------------
West bids 3S.
--------------------
B00 Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Hearts.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Heart contract...
4REVAL21: Adjusting by 1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Heart trump support including a trump honor & a void in Diamonds, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 4.0 to 8.0 points)
ROVRC5: Partner overcalled at the 2-level, indicating a good 5+ card Heart suit, 9.5-14.5 points, and probably 6+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 17.5-22.5 points.
ROVRC10: This is not enough to bid any higher, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 4S.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 4 Spades.  Declarer is East; South leads.
=======================
PL03: Starting play as right-hand defender.
PLDF55: With no cards in Diamonds, trump with the S3.
RCP5A: North is now known to have started with 0 Diamonds.
PLYLDB: With no other clear plays available, lead a card from the unbid Club suit.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<NO South bid Hearts
PLYSIG1: Partner discarded low with the two, so consider it a signal that he dislikes the suit.
PLAYDF2: Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
PLDF2H1: Play second hand low with the six.
