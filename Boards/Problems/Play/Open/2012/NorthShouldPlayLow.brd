Planning the play...
Combined hand (Dummy/Hand):
  S:AJ72 (7/AJ2)
  H:KT832 (K832/T)
  D:AKQJT9863 (KQT83/AJ96)
  C:AKQJ9532 (J52/AKQ93)
Combined hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 28.0, Distn pts = 4.0;
  Total pts = 32.0.
  QT's = 5.5,
  Stoppers in: S, H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  10 Sure Winners (1/0/5/4)
  10 Eventual Winners (1/0/5/4)
  3 Possible Losers (vs. 4 allowable)
PLN10: We have 10 sure tricks against a requirement of 9 for the 3NT contract.
PLNDRP1: Looking at the hand for drop plays...
PLNDRP3: Can play the Ace of Clubs in hand to try and drop the opponents' ten.
PLNDRP5: One drop play is available.

PLNFNS0: Looking for possible finesses...
PSFNS11: Can finesse the Jack of Spades in hand with the Ace as the potential cover card.
PSFNS30: Can finesse the King of Hearts by leading to it from hand against West.  <<<<<<<<<<<<Problem: AQJ9 left outstanding - we'll lose all Heart tricks
PSFNS44: Can opportunistically finesse the King of Hearts in dummy against East.
PLNFNS90: A total of 3 possible finesses exist.

PLNDEV0: Looking for ways to force out enemy top cards and promote our own......
PLNDEV95: No suit development plays have been found.
PLNCSH1: Looking at the hand for cashes...
PLNCSH3: We can cash 1 card in Spades, plus 4 in Clubs, plus 5 in Diamonds.
PLNCSH30: A total of 10 maximum cashing tricks are immediately available. 0 require cards to have been played
PLYSCN: Reviewing available plays...
PLTSTB: Checking logic of selected plays against bidding history...
PLTSTP: Checking logic of selected plays against play history...
PLNF1: Done examining plays...
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
PLNNT90A: We have 14 plays and approx. 10+ possible tricks including 10 sure tricks (vs. 9 required) accounted for in the plan.
PLNPRI: The Club suit looks the most promising for further development.
PLSEQ: Checking play sequencing...
PLSEQ1: Since we have enough cashing tricks (9) to fulfill the contract, we can just proceed with the cashing.
PLSEQ3: Since we have enough sure tricks (10) to fulfill the contract, we moved 10 cash plays forward
PLSEQ50: Move the opportunistic HK Finesse to the front.
PINTLV: Interleaving plays...
PINTLV10: Postpone the [CA Cash] so the suit winners in dummy are cashed first, to avoid possible stranding.
PINTLV10: Postpone the [CK Cash] so the suit winners in dummy are cashed first, to avoid possible stranding.
PINTLV10: Postpone the [CQ Cash] so the suit winners in dummy are cashed first, to avoid possible stranding.
PINTLV10: Postpone the [DK Cash] so the suit winners in hand are cashed first, to avoid possible stranding.
PINTLV10: Postpone the [DQ Cash] so the suit winners in hand are cashed first, to avoid possible stranding.
PINTLV55: The play: [Finesse the HK] needs to be started from the hand.
PLN90: The tentative list of available plays is as follows:
------>
