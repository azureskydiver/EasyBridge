Planning the play...
Combined hand (Dummy/Hand):
  S:AKJT652 (AKT5/J62)

PLN10: We have 12 sure tricks against a requirement of 11 for the 5D contract.
PLNPRI: The Spade suit looks the most promising for further development.
PLSEQ: Checking play sequencing...
PLSEQ6: We want to work on developing the Spade suit first, so move its plays up to the front if possible.
PINTLV: Interleaving plays...
PLN90: The tentative list of available plays is as follows:
------>
 Play 1: Pull a round of trumps with the nine in dummy.
 Play 2: Pull a round of trumps with the King in hand.
 Play 3: Pull a round of trumps with the Queen in hand if necessary.
 Play 4: Pull a round of trumps with the Jack in hand if necessary.
 Play 5: Ruff a Spade in hand.
 Play 6: Lead a low Spade from hand to finesse the ten in dummy against East, with the { SA SK  } as possible cover cards.
 Play 7: Lead the Spade Jack from hand and finesses it, with the { SA SK  } in dummy as possible cover cards.
 Play 8: Lead a low Spade from dummy and finesse the Jack in hand against West.
 Play 9: Cash the Ace of Spades in dummy.
 Play 10: Cash the King of Spades in dummy.
 Play 11: Ruff a Club in hand.
 Play 12: Ruff a Club in hand.

PLN95: The planning is complete.
---------------------------
PL2FN30: LHO has led the S9, which is the same suit as our SJ finesse card and lower in value, so we can still try the finesse.
PL3FN36: Play low Spade (the five) from dummy to opportunistically finesse the Jack in hand.
