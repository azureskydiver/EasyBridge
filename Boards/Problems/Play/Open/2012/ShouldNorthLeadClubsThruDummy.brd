====================
South bids 2D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
B00 Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Diamonds.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Diamond contract...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
RWKT: Partner made a weak 2-bid, showing a a 6+ card suit with 5.5-10.5 points, less than 4 cards in the other major, no voids, and no more than one singleton.
RWKT4: We only have 6.0/7.0/6.0 points, for a partnership total of 11.5-16.5 points, which is probably not enough for game.
RWKT10: And since we don't like partner's Diamond suit (holding 93), have no good suit of our own, and hold an imbalanced hand, we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East doubles.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 3H.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.
