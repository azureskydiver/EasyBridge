[[File Comments]]
3S is a poor openng lead. Declarer has shown a 4 card spade suit during the bidding. 

South (dummy) has used stayman, so is expected to have 4 hearts. But leading dummy's suit would be better than leading declarers suit,

So 4H (second highest to show that they have no honours in the suit) would be an ok lead, but the best option is probably 3D.
