[[File Comments]]
West should not lead away from DK
>>>>>>>>>>>>WEST<<<<<<<<<<<<
PL02: Starting play as left-hand defender.
PLYLEAD: Making opening lead as West against a contract of 4 Spades.
PLYLD4A: Lead the fourth card from our best suit (Hearts) -- play the H6.
PLYSIG1: Partner discarded low with the three, so consider it a signal that he dislikes the suit.
PLAYB48: We can't beat North's Jack, so discard the S3.
PLAYDF2: Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
PLDF2G4: Keep declarer from finessing the King, win now with the Ace.
PLYLDB: With no other clear plays available, lead a card from the unbid Diamond suit.  <<<<<<<<<<<<NO
