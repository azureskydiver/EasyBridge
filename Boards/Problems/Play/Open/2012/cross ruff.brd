Checking play sequencing...
We want to work on developing the Diamond suit first, so move its plays up to the front if possible.

The tentative list of available plays is as follows:
------>
 Play 1: Lead a low trump from dummy to finesse the ten in hand against West, with the Ace as cover.
 Play 2: Ruff a Diamond in hand.
 Play 3: Ruff a Diamond in hand.
 Play 4: Ruff a Diamond in hand.
 Play 5: Ruff a Diamond in hand.
 Play 6: Cash the Ace of Diamonds in dummy.

 Play 12: Cash the King of Spades in dummy.
 Play 13: Cash the Ace of Spades in hand.
 Play 14: Cash the Queen of Spades in hand.
The planning is complete.
