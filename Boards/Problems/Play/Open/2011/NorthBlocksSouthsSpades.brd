OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.

REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Spade contract...
4REVAL21: Adjusting by 1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Spade trump support including a trump honor, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 4.0 to 5.0 points)
ROVRC5: Partner overcalled at the 2-level, indicating a good 5+ card Spade suit, 9.5-14.5 points, and probably 6+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 14.5-19.5 points.
ROVRC10: This is not enough to bid any higher, so pass.
We pass.

East bids 3NT.
