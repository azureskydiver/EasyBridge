---------------------------
PLDM: Playing card from dummy.
PLNADJ: Reviewing play plan for round 7...
PLRV11: We have 7 reasonably sure tricks left vs. 5 more trick(s) required for the contract.
PLNDRP1: Looking at the hand for drop plays...
PLNDRP5: No drop plays are available.
PLNFNS0: Looking for possible finesses...
PLNFNS95: No immediate finesses have been found.
PLNDEV0: Looking for ways to force out enemy top cards and promote our own......
PLNDEV95: No suit development plays have been found.
PLNRF0: Looking for ruffing tricks...
PLNRF1: We can potentially ruff up to 2 Spades in hand.
PLNRF1: We can potentially ruff up to 1 Diamond in dummy after discarding the 1 loser from dummy.
PLNRF5: Up to 3 ruffs can be used (1 in dummy/2 in hand) out of a total of 3 available, but require 1 discard(s) first.
PLNRF8: This consists of the { D6 } from dummy.
PLNCSH1: Looking at the hand for cashes...
PLNCSH3: We can cash 3 cards in Spades, plus 3 in Clubs.
PLNCSH30: A total of 6 maximum cashing tricks are immediately available. 1 require cards to have been played
PLNTRMP: Evaluating the trumps situation...
PLNTRMP3: We have 5 probable winners from long suits so will try one more trump pull.
PLNTRMP5: We can safely play up to 2 rounds of trumps without endangering the contract.
PLNTRMP6: However, we only need to pull a maximum of 0 rounds to collect all the outstanding trumps.
PLNTRMP9: This will result in  1 round of trumps, 4 cashing tricks in the side suits, and up to 3 ruffing tricks.
PLYSCN: Reviewing available plays...
PLYSCN9: The play <H7 Trump Pull> is no longer viable as the opponents no longer hold any of the required alternative cards of [---].
PLYSCNX: 1 play(s) have been deleted as they are no longer viable.
PLTSTP: Checking logic of selected plays against play history...
PLNF1: Done examining plays...
