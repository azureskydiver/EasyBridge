Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 16.0, Distn pts = 4.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 17.0.
  QT's = 4.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  6 Likely Winners (1/1/5/-1)
  7 Likely Losers (1/0/1/5)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Have a powerful suit in Diamonds.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
North bids 1S.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCTK: With 16.0/17.0 points, the hand is too strong for a simple overcall, so start by doubling.
We bid Dbl.
--------------------
South bids 2H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North bids 2S.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of Double and partner's pass.
TKOUT: With 16.0/17.0 points and support for all unbid suits, bid a takeout double again.
We bid Dbl.
--------------------
South bids 2NT.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of Double and partner's pass.
TKRb10: After interference from the left-hand opponent, partner passed our takeout.
B3A20: Partner passed, showing < 6 points, so with 16.0/17.0 points in hand and 17.0-26.0 total partnership points, we have no choice but to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 No Trump.  Declarer is South; West leads.
=======================
PL03: Starting play as right-hand defender.
PLDF37: Partner's three might not win the round, so top it with the Ace.
PLYLDRT2: We'd like to return partner's Spades suit, but dummy will most likely win.
PLYLD76: Continue developing partner's Spade suit by playing the S8.
RCP5A: South is now known to have started with 1 Spade.
PLAYDF2: Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
PLDF2A: Play our only card in the suit, the Ace.
PLYLD4A: Lead the fourth card from our best suit (Diamonds) -- play the D7.   <<<<<<<<<<<<<< NO
PLYLD81: With no other obvious plays, fourth best with the D7.
PLYSIG1: Partner discarded low with the two, so consider it a signal that he dislikes the suit.
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Diamonds.
