--------------------
North bids 1NT.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL3: But we lack the strength with 14.0 pts for a simple overcall.
TKOUT: With 14.0/14.0 points and support for all unbid suits, bid a takeout double.
We bid Dbl.
--------------------
South bids 2NT.
--------------------
West passes.

North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of Double and partner's pass.
TKRb10: After interference from the left-hand opponent, partner passed our takeout.
B3A20: Partner passed, showing < 6 points, so with 14.0/14.0 points in hand and 14.0-23.0 total partnership points, we have no choice but to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 No Trump.  Declarer is North; East leads.

PLYLD4N: Lead the fourth card from our longest suit (Spades) -- play the S2.
RCP5A: North is now known to have started with 1 Spade.
PLDIS12: We do not have a winner in the Spade suit, so discard low with the seven.

PLYLD76: Continue developing our Spade suit by playing the S9.
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Spades.

PLYLD84: With no other obvious plays, cash a winner with the DK.
