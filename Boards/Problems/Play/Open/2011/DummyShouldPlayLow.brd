====================
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.

North passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
A00: Have 19.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
A10: This exceeds the max pts for a 1NT opening (17), but is less than min pts for 2NT (20).  So bid the lowest openable suit of 1 Club for now, then try for a jump shift to 2NT later.
We bid 1C.
--------------------
South doubles.
--------------------
West bids 1D.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Club and partner's response of 1 Diamond.
B3U00a: Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid after an earlier pass, Diamonds over Clubs, which shows 5.5-11.5 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
4REVAL21: Adjusting by 1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Diamond trump support including a trump honor, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 19.0 to 20.0 points)
B3U74: With less than game-level support for partner's Diamond suit (holding AQT), but with 19.0/19.0/20.0 points and a second suit in Spades (holding AQ63), show it by jump shifting to 2 Spades.
We bid 2S.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 3S.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
RDR0: With a single raise, partner is showing 6.0-11.5 points and decent (3-4 card) support for our Spade suit.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 5.
2REVAL18: Declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract in Spades from 19.0 down to 17.0 points)
RDR5: With a total of only 23.0-28.5 points in the partnership, we have to pass partners's  3 Spades bid.
We pass.
