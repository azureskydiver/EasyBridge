Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suits are  Clubs, Diamonds
The best suit is Diamonds.
====================
Opening bid for team.
Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 1D.
--------------------
South bids 1S.
--------------------
West doubles.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Spade.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Spade suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 10.0-17.0 points.
ROVRC10: This is not enough to bid any higher, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 2H.
--------------------
South bids 2S.
--------------------
West bids 4H.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Spade, Pass, and 2 Spades.
B4C4: Partner made a minimum rebid of his Spade suit at 2 Spades, showing 10.0-16.0 points and 5+ trump cards.
B4C10: With 4.0/2.5 points in the hand, for a total in the partnership of 12.5-18.5 points, we have to settle for the current bid and pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 4 Hearts.  Declarer is East; South leads.
=======================
PL03: Starting play as right-hand defender.
PLDF25: Play our only card in the suit, the two.
PLDF55: With no cards in Spades, trump with the H8.   <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
RCP5A: North is now known to have started with 1 Spade.
PLYLDD: With no other obvious plays, play D7.
