====================
PL02: Starting play as left-hand defender.
PLYLEAD: Making opening lead as East against a contract of 2 Spades.
PLYLD4E: We don't want to lead from the trump suit, so lead the 4th best from the Heart suit -- the H6.
RCP25: Dummy is shown to be void in Spades.
PLDIS12: We do not have a winner in the Heart suit, so discard low with the eight.
PLDF48: We can't beat North's King, so discard the H8.
PLAYDF2: Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
PLDF2H1: Play second hand low with the six.
RCP5A: North is now known to have started with 1 Diamond.
PLAYB48: We can't beat South's Ace, so discard the D7.
PLAYB55: With no cards in Clubs, trump with the S2.
RCP5A: East is now known to have started with 0 Clubs.
PLYLDA: With no other obvious plays, cash a winner with the HQ.
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Hearts.
PLAYDF2: Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
PLDF2J2: Since there is at least one higher card outstanding in the Club suit than the one led (the four), partner could still have it and win the round.
PLDF2N4: We don't think partner will win the round, so trump with the six.
PLYLDD: With no other obvious plays, play DK.
PLAYDF2: Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
PLDF2H1: Play second hand low with the nine.
PLAYDF2: Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
