--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 3 Hearts.
REVAL38: (with 3-card Heart trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Clubs, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 14.0 to 16.0 points)
SHUTR0: Partner made a preemptive 3 Hearts bid, showing a 7-card Heart suit with no tricks outside the suit, and most likely 5.0-8.0 points.
SHUTR9: With 14.0/14.0/16.0 points in hand, for a total of 21.0-24.0 points in the partnership, holding A65 in support of partner's Heart suit, and with only 2.5 QTs and 7 likely winners, we have no real reason to bid anything, so just pass.
We pass.
