F00: Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
F01a: Have 10.0/9.0/11.0 pts with an available 5-card major suit in Hearts (J9432), so bid 1 Heart over partner's minor suit 1 Club bid.
We bid 1H.

BXPNT5: With a total of 22.0-30.5 / 22.0-30.5 pts in the partnership, we lack adequate strength for a further raise beyond partner's 3 No Trump bid, so we have to pass.
We pass.
