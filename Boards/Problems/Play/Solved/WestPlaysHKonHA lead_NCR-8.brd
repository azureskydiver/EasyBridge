  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  8 Likely Winners (3/1/1/3)
  5 Likely Losers (2/1/1/1)
Playing five-card majors, Spades can be opened.
Preferred suits are  Clubs, Spades
The best suit is Spades.
====================
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1H.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
Have a good 5-card Spade suit with 16.0/16.0 points and 8 playing tricks, so overcall the opponents' 1 Heart with a bid of 1 Spade.
We bid 1S.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2H.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Spade and partner's pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 Hearts.  Declarer is South; West leads.
=======================
Starting play as left-hand defender.
Making opening lead as West against a contract of 2 Hearts.
Lead the SQ from the top of the { SQ SJ } sequence.
Dummy is now out of Spades.
Dummy is shown to be void in Spades.
Partner discarded low with the two, so consider it a signal that he dislikes the suit.
Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
There's a chance highcard will be picked up next trick, so win now with the King.
Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
Play our only card in the suit, the four.
Dummy is now out of Hearts.
