[[File Comments]]

This hand is open to quibbles about the bidding, but nothing is really bad until the final pass by East.
 
1.  South chooses to open 1S (others might prefer pass or 1C).
2. West passes (no issue)
3. North bids 2C (no issue)
4. East doubles (I would prefer 2H, but double is not terrible).
5. South redoubles (no-brainer)
6. West passes (I would prefer 2H with six hearts despite the weakness, because on the auction East must have hearts)
7. North passes (he doesn’t understand the redouble ?)
8. East passes – terrible bid
 
The main issue with East’s final pass is that he isn’t thinking in terms of damage control.  North/South stand to win MAJOR points if the redouble stands (East may only win his two aces), but while East may not make 2H, the loss should not be huge.  On it’s own merits 2H may be questionable to poor, but it has the overwhelming  advantage of preventing the major disaster of playing in 2C redoubled.  It looks like East doesn’t even try to assess the scoring risks of 2CXX making vs. the scoring risk of 2H or 2HX going down.
 
I realize that the gain/loss probability calculations are probably new ground in EasyBridge, and I am sure they are non-trivial.  However, in human bridge we try to make those judgments on a regular basis.  EasyBridge already estimates the combined partnership point count, so a gross attempt would be to assign an expected trick taking capability based on that (probably different for declarer vs. defender), and the consequent resulting expected scores.
