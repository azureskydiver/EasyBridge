S:8  H:QJ64  D:QJT  C:KJ654
Hand evaluation:

  QT's = 0.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  6 Likely Winners (0/2/1/3)
  7 Likely Losers (1/2/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
E07: Have 10.0 points in high cards in 3rd position and a openable Club suit, so bid 1 Club.
We bid 1C.
--------------------
South doubles.
--------------------
West bids 3C.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Club and partner's response of 3 Clubs.
S00: With a double raise and playing limit raises, partner is showing 10.0-12.0 points and 4+ card support for our Club suit.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
2REVAL16: (after re-evaluation for distribution, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 9.0 to 12.0 points)
S16: We have only 22.0-24.0 total points in the partnership for a minor suit, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
South passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 3 Clubs.  Declarer is East; South leads.
