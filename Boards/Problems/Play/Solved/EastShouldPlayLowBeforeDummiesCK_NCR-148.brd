[[File Comments]]
East should play low since CK is singleton
>>>>>>>> EAST <<<<<<<<<<
PLNADJ: Reviewing play plan for round 6...
PLRV10: We have only 4 reasonably sure tricks left vs. 6 more trick(s) required for the contract.
PLSEQ: Checking play sequencing...
PLSEQ6: We want to work on developing the Heart suit first, so move its plays up to the front if possible.
PINTLV: Interleaving plays...
PLDRP51: South led the C7; try to drop the one or more of the { CJ CT  } from North by playing the Queen from hand.  <<<<<<<<<< NO CK is singleton
