I have Unusual NT checked as Misc Bidding Option.
North overcalled West's 1C with 2NT - Unusual NT overcall would mean: 5D and 5H
>>>> NORTH <<<<
S:QJ32  H:K6  D:AKT  C:AK73
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 20.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 20.0.
  QT's = 4.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  8 Likely Winners (2/1/2/3)
  5 Likely Losers (2/1/1/1)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
