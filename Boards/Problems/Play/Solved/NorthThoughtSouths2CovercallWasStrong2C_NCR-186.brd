>>>>>>>>>>> NORTH<<<<
S:754  H:8543  D:AQ984  C:6
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 6.0, Distn pts = 2.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 6.0.
  QT's = 1.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  4 Likely Winners (0/0/4/0)
  9 Likely Losers (3/4/1/1)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
West bids 1D.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL3: But we lack the strength for a simple overcall.
B00: We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 1S.
--------------------
South bids 2C.
--------------------
West bids 2S.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Clubs.
ROVRC5: Partner overcalled at the 2-level, indicating a good 5+ card Club suit, 9.0-14.0 points, and probably 6+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 15.0-20.0 points.
ROVRC99: We have insufficient strength for either a raise, suit shift, or NT bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3C.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 2 Clubs, Pass, and 3 Clubs.
B4C0: Partner made a minimum rebid of his Club suit at 3 Clubs after his initial strong 2 Clubs opening, showing 22.0+ points and 5+ trump cards. <<<<< NOT 2C opening!!!
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
BN1: With 28.0+ HCPs in the partnership and a reasonably balanced hand, though without stoppers in all suits, bid 3 No Trump.
We bid 3NT.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 No Trump.  Declarer is North; East leads.
