North has underbid his hand - he should certainly raise to game with 4 winners and two trumps.

====================
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 3 Hearts.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL7: Adding 1 point(s) for the solid Club suit.
3REVAL6: Deducting 3 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 4.
Partner made a preemptive 3 Hearts bid, showing a 7-card Heart suit with no tricks outside the suit, and most likely 5.5-8.5 points.
With 14.0/14.5/14.5 points in hand, for a total of 20.0-23.0 points in the partnership, holding 52 in support of partner's Heart suit, and with only 3.0 QTs and 5 likely winners, we have no real reason to bid anything, so just pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Hearts.  Declarer is South; West leads.
