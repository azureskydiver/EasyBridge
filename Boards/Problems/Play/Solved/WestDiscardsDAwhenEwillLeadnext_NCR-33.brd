Opening bid for team.
Have 16.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Diamond.
We bid 1D.
--------------------
North passes.

East bids 1H.

South passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Diamond and partner's response of 1 Heart.
Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid after an earlier pass, Hearts over Diamonds, which shows 5.5-11.5 points and is forcing for one round.
(with 3-card Heart trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Clubs,  & a singleton in Spades, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 17.0 to 18.0 points)
With 3-card support for partner's Hearts (holding AJ6), 16.0/17.0/18.0 points, an unbalanced hand, our primary Diamond suit not jump rebiddable, and no second suit available, bid 2NT.
We bid 2NT.

We have only 7 sure tricks against a requirement of 8 for the 2NT contract.
The Club suit looks the most promising for further development.
Checking play sequencing...
We want to work on developing the Club suit first, so move its plays up to the front if possible.
Interleaving plays...
The tentative list of available plays is as follows:
------>
 Play 1: Lead a low Club from hand and finesse the King in dummy against South.
 Play 2: Lead a low Club from dummy and finesse the Queen in hand against North.
 Play 3: Cash the King of Clubs in dummy.
 Play 4: Lead a low Spade from dummy and finesse the Queen in hand against North.
 Play 5: Lead a low Heart from hand to finesse the ten in dummy against South, with the King as cover.
 Play 6: Lead a low Heart from dummy to finesse the Jack in hand against North, with the Ace as cover.
 Play 7: Play the Ten of Hearts from dummy to force out the opponents' Queen.
 Play 8: Play the Ten of Hearts from dummy to force out the opponents' Nine.
 Play 9: Cash the Ace of Diamonds in hand.
 Play 10: Cash the Queen of Diamonds in hand.
 Play 11: Cash the Jack of Diamonds in hand.
 Play 12: Cash the Ace of Hearts in hand.
 Play 13: Cash the Jack of Hearts in hand.
 Play 14: Cash the King of Hearts in dummy.
 Play 15: Cash the Eight of Hearts in dummy.
The planning is complete.
