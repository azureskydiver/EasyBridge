3REVAL6: Deducting 6 point(s) for the 3 trump(s) short of 3.
F00: Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
F01a: Have 15.0/15.0/15.0 pts with an available 6-card major suit in Spades (AKT984), so bid 1 Spade over partner's minor suit 1 Diamond bid.
But our bid (1 Spade) is too low vs. the last bid of of 2 Clubs, so we have to pass.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<PROBLEM WITH LEVEL !!!!!!!!!!

B4C20: With 27.0-31.0 points in the partnership, we want to explore slam opportunities.
YR4: Rebid the next best suit of Spades in a bid of 2 Spades.
B4C34: We have 15.0/15.0 pts in hand and 27.0-31.0 pts in the partnership, but have no good fit with partner and no rebiddable suit, so we have no choice but to shift to yet another suit.
We bid 2S.
