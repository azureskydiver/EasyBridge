N opened 2S and rebid (without any S support) and only had 4 cards in spade suit; Should have bid NT on 2nd bid since no support was shown?

--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Have a solid Diamond suit with 9 playing tricks and 5.0 quick tricks, so bid a strong 2 Spades.
We bid 2S.

East doubles.

South passes.

West bids 3D.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 2 Spades and partner's pass.
After our strong 2 Spades opening bid, partner's Pass bid was a positive response, indicating 1+ Quick Tricks.
With a balanced hand, bid game at 3 No Trump.
But we don't like partner's ???? suit (holding ), and we hold a good second suit in Diamonds, so show it in a rebid of 4 Diamonds.
But we don't like partner's ???? suit (holding ), so rebid our own Spade suit at 3 Spades.
We bid 3S.
