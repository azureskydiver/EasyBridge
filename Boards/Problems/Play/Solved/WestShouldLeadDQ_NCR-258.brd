S:A  H:AT9  D:QT87642  C:96
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 10.0, Distn pts = 3.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 10.0.
  QT's = 2.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  7 Likely Winners (1/1/5/0)
  6 Likely Losers (0/2/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
Opening bid for team.
Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North bids 1C.
--------------------
East bids 1S.
--------------------
South bids 2H.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Spade.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Spade suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 17.0-24.0 points.
ROVRC20: And although we want to bid our own 7-card Diamond suit, we can't bid it at the 3 with only 10.0 points, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North bids 3C.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3NT.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 No Trump.  Declarer is South; West leads.
=======================
PL02: Starting play as left-hand defender.
PLYLEAD: Making opening lead as West against a contract of 3 No Trump.
PLYLD4: Lead the top card of partner's Spade suit (the Ace.
PLYLD4A: Lead the fourth card from our best suit (Diamonds) -- play the D7.
PLYLD81: With no other obvious plays, fourth best with the D7.
PLAYDF2: Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
PLDF2E: South led an honor (the Jack), so cover it with our Ace.
PLYLD4A: Lead the fourth card from our best suit (Diamonds) -- play the D6.
PLYLD81: With no other obvious plays, fourth best with the D6.   <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< NO West has ALL of Diamonds. Lead DQ!!!
