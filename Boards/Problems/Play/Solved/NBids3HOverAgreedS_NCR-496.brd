In ACOL, 1S-2S indicates 6-9 points and support for Spades.
As a second issue, N bidding 3H is crazy - we alredy have a match in Spades and the opponents have bid Hearts!!!  North Must pass here.

North:
S:AQ65  H:QJ94  D:J83  C:A3
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 14.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-0.5;
Total pts = 13.5.
  QT's = 2.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Likely Winners (2/2/0/1)
  8 Likely Losers (2/2/3/1)
Preferred suit is Spades.
====================
Opening bid for team.
A00: Have 14.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
A02: But with an openable 4-card Heart suit, prefer to open in the major instead of in No Trump.
E01: Have 14.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Spade.
We bid 1S.
--------------------
East bids 2H.
--------------------
South bids 2S.
--------------------
West bids 3D.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Spade and partner's response of 2 Spades.
RDR0: With a single raise, partner is showing 9.0-12.0 points and decent (3-4 card) support for our Spade suit.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
2REVAL16: (after re-evaluation for distribution, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 13.5 to 14.5 points)
R14: Using the modified trick count, we have 3 playing tricks in hand and a total of 23.5-26.5 points in the partnership, so show the Heart support suit in a bid of 3 Hearts.
We bid 3H.
--------------------
East passes.
