Computer has interpreted my double of 1NT as takeout... In Acol, a double of 1NT is for penalties.  I don't know your system, so this may be an Acol-only issue. With North's flat distribution and only 2 HCP, I would expect a pass.


S:9863  H:JT3  D:843  C:J82
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 2.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.5;
Total pts = 0.5.
  QT's = 0.0,
  Sure Stoppers:
  Probable Stoppers in:
  -2 Likely Winners (-1/0/-1/0)
  15 Likely Losers (5/3/4/3)
Preferred suit is Spades.
====================
West bids 1NT.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
But we lack the strength for a simple overcall.
We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.

Responding to partner's opening double.
Partner has doubled for takeout.
Partner's takeout indicates 12.0+ HCPs, for a total in the partnership of 12.5-22.5 points.
With 2.0/0.5 pts, respond with our longest suit of Spades at a bid of 2 Spades.
We bid 2S.
