North bids 1S.

East bids 1NT.

South passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Diamond and partner's response of 1 No Trump.
B3J00: With a 1NT response, partner is showing 5.5-9.5 points, a lack of good support for our Diamond suit, and no other suit available to bid at an appropriate level.
B3K10: Partner doesn't like our Diamonds, but we don't have another suit we can bid, so rebid the suit at 2 Diamonds.
We bid 2D.
