East bids 1NT.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 No Trump.
Partner's bid indicates 15-17 points with balanced hand.
Responding with a  balanced hand and 9.0 HCP's, for a total in partnership of 24.0-26.0 HCPs.
If partner has a max opening hand (17 HCPs), we can make game at 3NT, and so we want to bid an invitational 2NT.  However, since we're playing 4-suit Jacoby Transfers, we have to bid 2C instead.
We bid 2C.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 5C.
