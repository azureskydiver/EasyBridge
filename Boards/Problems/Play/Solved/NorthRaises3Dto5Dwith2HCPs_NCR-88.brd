====================
South bids 2C.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Clubs.
R2CLUB: Partner made an artificial bid of 2 Clubs, showing either a game suit or 22+ points.  We want to respond positively if interested in a slam.
R2C04: With only 2.0/0.5 points, we deny interest in slam by making the negative response of 2 Diamonds.
We bid 2D.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 2 Clubs, 2 Diamonds, and 3 Diamonds.
R2CLR2: Partner showed his best suit of Diamonds in response to our negative 2D response.
REVAL38: (with 4-card Diamond trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Clubs, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 0.5 to 4.5 points)
R2CLR20: Raise partner's & Diamonds to game at 5 Diamonds.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< NOT ENOUGH ????????????
We bid 5D.
