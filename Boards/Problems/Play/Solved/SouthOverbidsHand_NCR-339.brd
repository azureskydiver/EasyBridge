RDR0: With a single raise, partner is showing 6.0-10.0 points and decent (3-4 card) support for our Club suit.
R40: With 22.0-26.0 total points in the partnership, we want to explore slam possibilities.  <<<<<<<<<<<< NOT ENOUGH 
R60: But since we cannot make a cue bid, make a slam invitation at 5 Clubs.  <<<<<<<<<<< 26 NOT enough for MINOR
