  QT's = 2.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, D

Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Spades.
====================
South bids 1S.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL3: But we lack the strength for a simple overcall.
B00: We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North bids 2C.
--------------------
East bids 3D.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<< NOTE Weak Jump overcall !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
--------------------
South bids 3H.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 3 Diamonds.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL5: Adding 1 point(s) for the 1 extra trump(s).
2REVAL38: (with 4-card Diamond trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Hearts, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 9.0 to 12.0 points)
F01: Partner, opening in fourth position, is showing 10.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
I14: Have 9.0/9.0/12.0 points but we prefer to shift instead of raising a minor Diamond suit, so show our own Spade suit by bidding 3 Spades. <<<< ???? 4D???
We bid 3S.
