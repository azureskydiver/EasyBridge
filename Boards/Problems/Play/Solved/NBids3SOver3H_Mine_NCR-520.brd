North's 3S bid is dreadful. He should know that S would only bid with at least a 5 card suit and should pass with 3 card support.

F01: Partner, opening in third position, is showing 10.0-20.5 points and 2+ QT's.
G08: Have 7.0/6.5/8.5 points and 3-card (Q86) Heart trump support playing 5-card majors, so raise to 2 Hearts.  <<<<<<<<<<< NOTE 2 level vs ???
But our bid (2 Hearts) is too low vs. the last bid of of 3 Hearts, so we have to pass.
