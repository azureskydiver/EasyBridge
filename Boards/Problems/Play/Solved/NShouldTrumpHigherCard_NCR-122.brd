N analysis
S:963  H:Q42  D:J  C:Q97543
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 5.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.5;
Total pts = 3.5.
  QT's = 0.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Likely Winners (0/1/0/4)
  8 Likely Losers (3/2/1/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
Opening bid for team.
Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 1C.
--------------------
South bids 1D.
--------------------
West bids 1S.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Diamond.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Diamond suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
The total point count in the partnership is therefore 11.0-18.0 points.
This is not enough to bid any higher, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 3S.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 4S.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 4 Spades.  Declarer is West; North leads.
=======================
Starting play as left-hand defender.
Making opening lead as North against a contract of 4 Spades.
Lead the top card of partner's Diamond suit (the Jack.
Although we could trump this hand, partner's DK is high, so discard the H2.
North is now known to have started with 1 Diamond.
Dummy is now out of Diamonds.
With no cards in Diamonds, trump with the S3.
