Norm,
 
East/West have one of the classic no-win deals.  Their result is not bad, but the bidding is poor.
 
North and South pass throughout.  East opens 2C (I am playing 20-21 point 2NT so with 23 HCP and a balanced hand the correct strategy is to open 2C, then rebid 2NT over West’s response).
 
West correctly bids 2D (bust response).
 
East bids 3C (his best suit) instead of the correct 2NT.
 
West passes, in spite of 3C being a forcing bid.  On this auction, East’s hand is unlimited in strength, so West must bid 3D, his best suit.  (Note that if East had correctly bid 2NT – limiting his hand to 22-23 HCP, then with 0 HCP West should pass).
 
Now 2NT is not a lot better than the actual 3C contract, but the point is both East and West screwed up the proper bidding sequence.
