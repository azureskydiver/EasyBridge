North bids 4NT over South's 4S ??? Not Blackwood???
>>>>>>>>> NORTH<<<<<<<
S:95  H:92  D:K987632  C:T2
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 3.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.0;
Total pts = 2.0.
  QT's = 0.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Likely Winners (0/0/5/0)
  8 Likely Losers (2/2/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
Opening bid for team.
D04: Have a 7-card Diamond suit with no tricks outside the suit, so make a shutout bid of 3 Diamonds.
We bid 3D.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 4S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 3 Diamonds and partner's response of 4 Spades.
B3Y00: Partner has made a jump shift to 4 Spades after our opening 3 Diamonds bid, which indicates 18.5+ points and is forcing to game (and points to a possible slam).   <<<<<<< 4S is game ????
B3Y28: With weak support for partner's Spades (holding 95), no rebiddable suit, and no good second suit, we have to show our strength by shifting to 4 No Trump.  <<<<<<<<<< ???? BLACKWOOD???
We bid 4NT.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 5S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
BXK06: Partner has rebid his suit twice, indicating 6+ cards.
BXK40: With no agreement in suits and 20.5-23.5 partnership points, pass partner's 5 Spades bid.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 5 Spades.  Declarer is South; West leads.
