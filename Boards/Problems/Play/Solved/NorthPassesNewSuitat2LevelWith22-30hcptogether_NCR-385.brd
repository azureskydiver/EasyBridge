North passed after partner changed suits... said not enough for game but calculates 22-30HCP's
=================
North analysis
S:K73  H:AQ3  D:QT42  C:Q86
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 13.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 13.0.
  QT's = 2.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  2 Likely Winners (0/1/1/0)
  11 Likely Losers (3/2/3/3)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
Opening bid for team.
Have 13.0 points in high cards and 2.0 quick tricks, so bid 1 Diamond.
We bid 1D.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2C.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Diamond and partner's response of 2 Clubs.
Partner has made a 2 over 1 bid, Clubs over Diamonds, which shows 9.5-17.5 points and is forcing for one round.
Adjusting by 1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Club trump support including a trump honor, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 13.0 to 14.0 points)
B3W42: But with only about 22.5-30.5 HCPS in the partnership, we don't have enough for game, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 Clubs.  Declarer is South; West leads.
