====================

We bid 1C.

--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3H.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Club and partner's pass.
B3A20: Partner passed, showing < 6 points, so with 11.0/11.0 points in hand and 11.0-20.0 total partnership points, we have no choice but to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North bids 4H.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 4 Hearts.  Declarer is North; East leads.
=======================
PL03: Starting play as right-hand defender.
PLDIS2: Since we can win the next round of Clubs, we want to signal by discarding high in the suit.
PLDIS8: Begin the high-low signal with the Jack.
PLDF36: Partner's ten is high or we can't beat the highest card, so discard the CJ.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<< TOO HIGH !!!!!
