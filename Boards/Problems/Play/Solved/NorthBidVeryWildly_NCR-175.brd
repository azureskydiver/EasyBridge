S:QT3  H:4  D:A  C:KQJT9853
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 12.0, Distn pts = 9.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 17.0.
  QT's = 2.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  9 Likely Winners (1/0/1/7)
  4 Likely Losers (2/1/0/1)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Have a strong suit in Clubs.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
West bids 1D.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
With 12.0/17.0 points, the hand is too strong for a simple overcall, so start by doubling.
We bid Dbl.
--------------------
East bids 1H.
--------------------
South bids 1S.
--------------------
West bids 4H.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of Double and partner's response of 1 Spade.
Partner has made a jump response of 1 Spade, indicating 10-12 pts and a 4-5 card suit.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<< NOT A JUMP????????????
The total point count in the partnership is therefore 27.0-29.0 pts.
The right-hand opponent has bid after partner's response, interfering with our communication.
Partner's forced response of 1 Spade not withstanding, we can now show the Club suit that we wanted to overcall with last round by bidding 6 Clubs. ???????????
We bid 6C.
--------------------
East doubles.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 6 Clubs and partner's pass.
Partner passed, showing < 6 points, so with 12.0/17.0 points in hand and 17.0-22.0 total partnership points, we have no choice but to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 6 Clubs (doubled).  Declarer is North; East leads.
