Why would N pass a 2nd bid of Clubs when he had none and had opening points... at a min seems he should bid NT and possibly 3NT.

====================
***Bidding restarted***
Opening bid for team.
Have 24.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
But with an openable 5-card Spade suit, prefer to open in the major instead of in No Trump.
Have 24.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Spade.
We bid 1S.

North passes.

East bids 2S.
