We pass.

PLYLD4A: Lead the fourth card from our best suit (Diamonds) -- play the D4.
PLDF38A: Playing third ahead of dummy, we need to beat dummy's Queen, so play the Ace.
PLYLDRT2: We'd like to return partner's Diamonds suit, but dummy will most likely win.
PLAYDF2: Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
PLDF2H1: Play second hand low with the seven.
PLAYDF2: Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
