I think N should have bid 3NT... I bed Clubs and Diamonds, N bit Spades twice but also had Hearts covered. I mentioned clubs looking for NT. N passed me when I bid Clubs and he only had 1; He had 3 diamonds, my first suit bid.

N analysis: ******************************************************************
S:KJ863  H:AQJ6  D:JT9  C:5
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 12.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 12.0.
  QT's = 2.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H
  Probable Stoppers in:
  6 Likely Winners (3/3/0/0)
  7 Likely Losers (2/1/3/1)
Playing five-card majors, Spades can be opened.
Preferred suits are  Hearts, Spades
The best suit is Spades.
====================
Opening bid for team.
Have 12.0 points in high cards, 2.0 quick tricks, and a rebiddable suit in Spades, so bid 1 Spade.
We bid 1S.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Spade and partner's response of 2 Diamonds.
Partner has made a 2 over 1 bid, Diamonds over Spades, which shows 9.5-17.5 points and is forcing for one round.
(with 3-card Diamond trump support including a trump honor & a singleton in Clubs, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 12.0 to 15.0 points)
With a rebiddable Spade suit and weak support for partner's Diamonds (holding JT9), rebid 2 Spades.
We bid 2S.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3C.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
With no agreement in suits, 21.5-29.5 / 24.5-32.5 partnership points, and no good alternatives, pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Clubs.  Declarer is South; West leads.
