=======================
Starting play as left-hand defender.
Making opening lead as West against a contract of 2 Diamonds.
Lead the top card of partner's Spade suit (the Queen.
We do not have a winner in the Club suit, so discard low with the six.
Partner's CA can win the trick, so discard the C6.
Dummy is now out of Clubs.
With no cards in Spades, trump with the D9.
West is now known to have started with 1 Spade.
With no good card to lead, lead the HJ since the opponents have not shown out of the Heart suit.
Although we could trump this hand, partner's SJ is high, so discard the C2.
Dummy is now out of Spades.
South is now known to have started with 3 Spades.
PLDF12: We'll trump high enough with DJ to beat dummy.
