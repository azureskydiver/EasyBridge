[[File Comments]]
North is confused by the bidding... my 1S is interpreted as 16-18 points and the log talks about a "jump raise" which doesn't exist in this sequence. SInce I passed the first time, my HCP holding must be low and North should pass. The 3NT is hopeless and we may only make 4 tricks!
