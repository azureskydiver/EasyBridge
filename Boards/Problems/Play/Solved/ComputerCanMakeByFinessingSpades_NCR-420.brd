PLNRF1: We can potentially ruff up to 0 Diamond in dummy after discarding the 1 loser from dummy.

PLNCSH3: We can cash 2 cards in Hearts, plus 4 in Spades.
PLNCSH30: A total of 6 maximum cashing tricks are immediately available.
PLNTRMP: Evaluating the trumps situation...
PLNTRMP5: We can safely play up to 1 round of trumps without endangering the contract.
PLNTRMP6: However, we only need to pull a maximum of 0 rounds to collect all the outstanding trumps.
PLNTRMP9: This will result in (up to) 0 rounds of trumps, 5 cashing tricks in the side suits, and up to 1 ruffing trick.
PLYSCN: Reviewing available plays...
PLTSTP: Checking logic of selected plays against play history...
PLNF1: Done examining plays...

PLSEQ: Checking play sequencing...
PLSEQ5: Since we have enough sure tricks (6) to fulfill the contract, we moved 2 plays forward
PLSEQ6: We want to work on developing the Heart suit first, so move its plays up to the front if possible.
PLSEQ6a: moved up 4 plays.
