E-W bidding goes badly wrong as West bids 4NT (blackwood) which East passes. 4NT goes 4 down but they shouldn't be going past game.

West:
S:9  H:J854  D:J985  C:AQJ3
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 9.0, Distn pts = 2.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;

  5 Likely Winners (0/1/1/3)

Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
North passes.

East bids 1S.

South doubles.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Spade.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 6 point(s) for the 3 trump(s) short of 4.
Partner is showing 12.0-21.5 points and 2+ QT's.
We have 9.0/9.0/9.0 points with poor support for partner's Spade suit (holding 9) and not enough strength for a 2/1 response to show our Club suit, so bid 1NT.
We bid 1NT.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 3H.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Spade, 1 No Trump, and 3 Hearts.
With 4 trumps in partner's second suit (Hearts), we prefer to support that suit.
Partner made a jump shift to 3 Hearts in response to our 1 No Trump bid, showing 19.0-22.0 points.  The bid is forcing to game.
Adjusting by 1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 4-card Heart trump support including a trump honor & a singleton in Spades, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 9.0 to 13.0 points)
with 9.0/9.0/13.0 points in the hand, for a total of approx. 28.0-31.0 / 32.0-35.0 pts in the partnership, explore slam possibilities with Blackwood at 4 No Trump.
We pick Hearts for the ultimate slam contract suit.
We bid 4NT.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South doubles.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
Partner responded to our 4NT Blackwood inquiry with Pass, indicating 0 Aces.
Oops, we're caught with only 1 Aces, so halt the bidding at the five-level.
Without all four aces we can't proceed to a grand slam, so stop at 1 Heart.
But our bid (1 Heart) is too low vs. the last bid of of 4 No Trump, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 4 No Trump (doubled).  Declarer is West; North leads.

We have only 7 sure tricks against a requirement of 10 for the 4NT X contract.
The Heart suit looks the most promising for further development.
Checking play sequencing...
We want to work on developing the Heart suit first, so move its plays up to the front if possible.
Interleaving plays...
The tentative list of available plays is as follows:
------>
 Play 1: Lead a low Heart from hand and finesse the King in dummy against South.
 Play 2: Lead a low Heart from dummy and finesse the Jack in hand against North.
 Play 3: Cash the King of Hearts in dummy.
 Play 4: Lead a low Club from dummy to finesse the Jack in hand against North, with the Ace as cover.
 Play 5: Lead a low Club from dummy to finesse the Queen in hand against North, with the Ace as cover.
 Play 6: Cash the Ace of Spades in dummy.
 Play 7: Cash the Queen of Spades in dummy.
 Play 8: Cash the Jack of Spades in dummy.
 Play 9: Cash the Ace of Clubs in hand.
 Play 10: Cash the Queen of Clubs in hand.
 Play 11: Cash the Ace of Diamonds in dummy.
The planning is complete.
