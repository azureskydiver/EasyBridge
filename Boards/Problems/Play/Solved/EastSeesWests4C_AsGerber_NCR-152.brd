North passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
South passes.

West bids 2C.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Clubs.
Partner made an artificial bid of 2 Clubs, showing either a game suit or 20+ points.  We want to respond positively if interested in a slam.
With 9.0/7.5 points we have to respond with our best suit of Hearts by bidding 2 Hearts.
We bid 2H.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 3C.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 2 Clubs, 2 Hearts, and 3 Clubs.
Partner bid another suit at 3 Clubs after opening an artificial 2C, indicating 23.0-22.0 points in his hand.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
Without a compelling suit of our own, and with lackluster support for partner's two suits, we prefer to play in No Trumps.
With a total of 32.0-31.0 HCPs in the partnership, no rebiddable suit or good second suit, and a lack of good support for either of partner's suits, bid 3 No Trump.
We bid 3NT.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 4C.
