East should trump. Makes bad comment about winning with JH when the QH has been played on trick.
East analysis
S:A93  H:K  D:Q5  C:AKQT763
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 18.0, Distn pts = 3.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-2.5;
Total pts = 18.5.
  QT's = 3.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  8 Likely Winners (1/0/0/7)
  5 Likely Losers (2/1/2/0)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Have a powerful suit in Clubs.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
North bids 1D.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
With 18.0/18.5 points, the hand is too strong for a simple overcall, so start by doubling.
We bid Dbl.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 1H.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of Double and partner's response of 1 Heart.
Partner has made a minimum response of 1 Heart, indicating no more than 9 points.
The total point count in the partnership is therefore 18.5-27.5 pts.
Partner's forced response of 1 Heart not withstanding, we can now show the Club suit that we wanted to overcall with last round by bidding 2 Clubs.
We bid 2C.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 Clubs.  Declarer is East; South leads.

---------------------------
Planning the play...
Combined hand (Dummy/Hand):
  S:AKQ932 (KQ2/A93)
  H:KJ753 (J753/K)
  D:QJ985 (J98/Q5)
  C:AKQT976532 (952/AKQT763)
Combined hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 25.0, Distn pts = 3.0;
  Total pts = 28.0.
  QT's = 4.5,
  Stoppers in: S, H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  6 Sure Winners (3/0/0/3)
  9 Eventual Winners (3/0/0/6)
  4 Possible Losers (vs. 5 allowable)
We have 9 sure tricks against a requirement of 8 for the 2C contract.
The Heart suit looks the most promising for further development.
Checking play sequencing...
We can fulfill the contract by pulling 3 round(s) of trumps, and cashing the SA, SK, SQ, CT, C9 and C7.
Interleaving plays...
The tentative list of available plays is as follows:
------>
 Play 1: Pull a round of trumps with the Queen in hand if necessary.
 Play 2: Pull a round of trumps with the King in hand.
 Play 3: Pull a round of trumps with the Ace in hand.
 Play 4: Ruff a Heart in hand.
 Play 5: Ruff a Heart in hand.
 Play 6: Ruff a Heart in hand.
 Play 7: Ruff a Diamond in hand.
 Play 8: Cash the Ace of Spades in hand.
 Play 9: Cash the King of Spades in dummy.
 Play 10: Cash the Queen of Spades in dummy.
 Play 11: Cash the Nine of Clubs in dummy.
 Play 12: Cash the Ten of Clubs in hand.
 Play 13: Cash the Queen of Clubs in hand.
 Play 14: Cash the King of Clubs in hand.
 Play 15: Cash the Ace of Clubs in hand.
 Play 16: Cash the Seven of Clubs in hand.
 Play 17: Lead a low Heart from hand and finesse the Jack in dummy against North.
 Play 18: Lead a low Heart from dummy and finesse the King in hand against South.
 Play 19: Lead a low Diamond from hand and finesse the Jack in dummy against North.
 Play 20: Lead a low Diamond from dummy and finesse the Queen in hand against South.
The planning is complete.
---------------------------
Play low Diamond (the eight) from dummy to opportunistically finesse the Queen in hand.
RHO has played a higher card (the King) than our intended finesse (the Queen), so skip the play.
No usable plays found for the current situation.
Use this opportunity to discard the D5.
We can't beat North's King, so discard the D5.
Reviewing play plan for round 2...
We have 8 reasonably sure tricks left vs. 8 more trick(s) required for the contract.
Checking play sequencing...
We can fulfill the contract by pulling 3 round(s) of trumps, and cashing the DQ, DJ, HK, HJ, SA, SK, SQ and CT.
Interleaving plays...
the card led (DA)  beats the DQ we were going to play, so skip the cash for now.
