[[File Comments]]
North knows that South’s 2C bid after North’s opening 1H is forcing, but still passes anyway !  
North has a solid 13 HCP and seems scared that he has a singleton ace in the club suit.  
North’s calculates 23 to 31 HCP in the combined hands so he passes !  
The min may be short of game, but the max is well over.
North passes a forcing response:

North's analysis:

S:QT87  H:T8764  D:AKT  C:A
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 13.0, Distn pts = 2.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0; Total pts = 13.0.
  QT's = 3.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  3 Likely Winners (1/0/1/1)
  10 Likely Losers (3/5/2/0)
Playing five-card majors, Hearts can be opened.
Preferred suits are  Hearts, Spades
The best suit is Hearts.
====================
***Bidding restarted***
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Have 13.0 points in high cards and 3.0 quick tricks, so bid 1 Heart.
We bid 1H.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2C.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Heart and partner's response of 2 Clubs.
Partner has made a 2 over 1 bid, Clubs over Hearts, which shows 10.0-18.0 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Club contract...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
But with only about 23.0-31.0 HCPS in the partnership, we don't have enough for game, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 Clubs.  Declarer is South; West leads.
