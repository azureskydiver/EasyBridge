North passes.

East bids 1C.
--------------------
South bids 3S.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Club.
(with 5-card Club trump support including a trump honor & doubletons in Diamonds and Spades, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 9.0 to 15.0 points)
Partner, opening in third position, is showing 10.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
Have 9.0/9.0/15.0 points but prefer not to raise a minor, so bid our 4-card major Heart suit instead at 4 Hearts.
We bid 4H.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 4 Hearts.  Declarer is West; North leads.
