Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Hearts.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
ROVRC3: Partner made a weak jump overcall of 2 Hearts, indicating 5.0-9.0 pts and a good 6+ card Heart suit.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 12.5-16.5 points.
ROVRC99: We have insufficient strength for either a raise, suit shift, or NT bid, so pass.
We pass.

=======================
PL02: Starting play as left-hand defender.
PLYLEAD: Making opening lead as West against a contract of 3 Spades.
PLYLD4: Lead the top card of partner's Heart suit (the Jack.
PLDF25: Play our only card in the suit, the nine.
RCP5A: South is now known to have started with 2 Hearts.
PLDF54: Although we could trump this hand, partner's HT is high, so discard the D6.
RCP5A: West is now known to have started with 2 Hearts.
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Hearts.
PLDF38A: Playing third ahead of dummy, we need to beat dummy's King, so play the Ace.
PLYLDRT2: We'd like to return partner's Clubs suit, but dummy will most likely win.
PLYLDD: With no other obvious plays, play C2.
PLYSIG0: Partner discarded high with the nine, so consider it a suit preference signal.
PLAYB48: We can't beat South's Ace, so discard the S4.
PLAYDF2: Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
PLDF2A1: Play the top card in the suit, the ten.
