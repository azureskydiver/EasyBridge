Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 8.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 8.0.
  QT's = 2.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  2 Likely Winners (-1/0/4/-1)
  11 Likely Losers (4/2/1/4)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Have a strong suit in Diamonds.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
South bids 1H.
--------------------
West doubles.
--------------------
North bids 3H.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
TKOTR: Partner has doubled for takeout.
TKOTR8: Partner's takeout indicates 12.5+ HCPs, for a total in the partnership of 20.5-29.5 points.
TKOTR12: But Right-hand opponent has bid after partner's double, so the takeout is no longer in effect.
TKOTR17: And with only 8.0/8.0 points, we choose to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Hearts.  Declarer is South; West leads.
=======================
PL03: Starting play as right-hand defender.
PLDIS12: We do not have a winner in the Club suit, so discard low with the three.
PLDF47: Partner's CK can win the trick, so discard the C3.
PLDF47: Partner's CA can win the trick, so discard the C5.
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Diamonds.
PLDF37: Partner's ten might not win the round, so top it with the King.
PLYLDRT1: We'd like to return partner's Diamonds suit, but dummy might ruff.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<< YES <<<<<<<<<<
PLYLDRT8: Return partner's Diamond suit with the Ace.
PLYSIG1: Partner discarded low with the two, so consider it a signal that he dislikes the suit.
