S:72  H:632  D:AT8764  C:A9
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 8.0, Distn pts = 2.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 8.0.
  QT's = 2.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  3 Likely Winners (0/-1/3/1)
  10 Likely Losers (2/4/3/1)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
Opening bid for team.
Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Spades.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
RWKT: Partner made a weak 2-bid, showing a a 6+ card suit with 5.0-10.0 points, less than 4 cards in the other major, no voids, and no more than one singleton.
RWKT4: We only have 8.0/8.0/8.0 points, for a partnership total of 13.0-18.0 points, which is probably not enough for game.
RWKT8: And we don't like partner's Spade suit (holding 72), so shift to our preferred Diamond suit in a bid of 3 Diamonds. <<<<<<<<<<<<<< NO PASS
We bid 3D.

East passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 3 Diamonds.  Declarer is North; East leads.
