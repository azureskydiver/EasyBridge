Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suits are  Clubs, Diamonds
The best suit is Diamonds.
====================
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
E01: Have 17.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Diamond.
We bid 1D.
--------------------
South bids 1S.
--------------------
West bids 2D.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Diamond and partner's response of 2 Diamonds.
RDR0: With a single raise, partner is showing 6.0-10.0 points and decent (3-4 card) support for our Diamond suit.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
3REVAL8: Since the trump suit is only topped by a ten, deduct 1 points.
2REVAL18: Declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 17.0 down to 16.0 points)
R40: With 22.0-26.0 total points in the partnership, we want to explore slam possibilities.
R60: But since we cannot make a cue bid, make a slam invitation at 5 Diamonds.
We bid 5D.
--------------------
South doubles.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 5 Diamonds and partner's pass.
B3A20: Partner passed, showing < 6 points, so with 17.0/17.0 points in hand and 16.0-21.0 total partnership points, we have no choice but to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 5 Diamonds (doubled).  Declarer is East; South leads.
