Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Club and partner's response of 1 Heart.
B3U00a: Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid after an earlier pass, Hearts over Clubs, which shows 5.0-11.0 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL7: Adding 3 point(s) for the solid Club suit.
3REVAL5: Adding 1 point(s) for the -1 extra trump(s).
RevV0: We'd like to bid the Diamond suit, but we can't reverse with less than 17 points.
RevV2: And since the 3rd best suit (Hearts) is not strong enough to bid, we have to rebid the original Club suit.
B3U18a: With poor support for partner's Heart suit (holding 74), and no other suit available to bid, rebid the Club suit at 2 Clubs.
We bid 2C.
--------------------
South bids 2S.

West passes.
--------------------
North passes.

Rebidding after opening bid of 2 Clubs and partner's pass.

We pass.
