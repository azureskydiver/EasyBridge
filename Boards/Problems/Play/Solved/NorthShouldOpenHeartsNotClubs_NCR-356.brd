I think N should open 5 card hearts rather than 5 card clubs
==============================
S:Q9  H:KQT85  D:Q  C:KJ832
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 13.0, Distn pts = 3.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-3.0;
Total pts = 10.0.
  QT's = 1.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  6 Likely Winners (0/3/0/3)
  7 Likely Losers (2/2/1/2)
Playing five-card majors, Hearts can be opened.
Preferred suits are  Clubs, Hearts
The best suit is Hearts.
====================
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Have 13.0 points in high cards , so bid a Convenient minor 1 Club.
We bid 1C.
--------------------
East bids 1S.
--------------------
South bids 2D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Club and partner's response of 2 Diamonds.
Partner has made a 2 over 1 bid, Diamonds over Clubs, which shows 9.5-17.5 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
With weak 1-card support for partner's Diamonds (holding Q) and a openable second suit in Hearts (holding KQT85), show it in a 2 Hearts bid.
We bid 2H.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3C.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
Partner has returned to our first suit, raising it to 3 Clubs.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
2REVAL16: (after re-evaluation for distribution, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 10.0 to 13.0 points)
With 22.5-30.5 points in the partnership and no aspirations for a higher contract, we sign off on partner's bid of 3 Clubs.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Clubs.  Declarer is North; East leads.
