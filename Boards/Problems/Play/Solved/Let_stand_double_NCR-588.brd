Letting a double stand
Norm,
 
Looking at West’s analysis for his final pass, it seems like he suffers from amnesia.  East opened 1H (reasonable), South passes, West makes a temporizing bid of 2D (we are playing Jacoby 2NT so it seems that is what should be bid, but 2D isn’t terrible), North doubles for takeout (fine), East passes (okay, I guess, since his was a minimum opener), South passes (converting to penalty double, willing to play in 2Dx), then West thinks his partner has less than 6 points for his latest pass and passes himself ???  West completely forgot that East had opened, that his own 2D bid was only temporizing and that he really wanted to play in Hearts.
 
I am still playing bidding aggressiveness at +2, but still...
 
If I set bidding aggressiveness at 0, then East passes instead of opening 1H, so the whole situation never arises.

>>>>>>>>> WEST<<<<<<<<<<<

4REVAL21: Adjusting by 0 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.

REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer for Heart contract...
2REVAL16: (after re-evaluation for distribution, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 11.0 to 12.0 points)
I08: Have 12.0/11.0/15.0 points with 5-card support for partner's Hearts (holding AJ853), which is too strong for a limit raise, so we have to temporarily shift to Diamonds with a bid of 2 Diamonds.
We bid 2D.

South passes.

Rebidding after opening bid of 2 Diamonds and partner's pass.    <<<<<<<???????????? Pardner opened ????
B3A20: Partner passed, showing < 6 points, so with 12.0/11.0 points in hand and 11.0-16.0 total partnership points, we have no choice but to pass.
We pass.
