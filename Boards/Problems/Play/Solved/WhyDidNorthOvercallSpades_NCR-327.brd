West doubles.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Heart.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
Have 7.0/7.0/7.0 points with poor (K2) support for partner's Heart suit but hold a weak Spade suit, so bid 1 Spade instead.
We bid 1S.

East bids 1NT.
--------------------
South bids 2NT.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Heart, 1 Spade, and 2 No Trump.
Partner's shift from our 1 Spade bid to 2 No Trump indicates a balanced hand and 13.0+ points, for a total of 20.0+ points in the partnership.
with 7.0/7.0 points in hand, and a total of 20.0-23.0 in the partnership, we can't make game, so pass.
We pass.

East passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 2 No Trump.  Declarer is South; West leads.
