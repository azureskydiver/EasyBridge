Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVERCL8: Have a good 5-card Diamond suit with 16.0/16.0 points and 8 playing tricks, so overcall the opponents' 1 Heart with a bid of 2 Diamonds.
We bid 2D.

East bids 2H.

South bids 3C.

West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 2 Diamonds and partner's response of 3 Clubs.
OVRRB22: Partner bid his own Clubs suit at the 3 level in response to our 2 Diamonds overcall, indicating 6+ cards and approx. 13.0-22.0 points.
OVRRB80: As we lack agreement in suits and have only 29.0-38.0 team points, we have no good options other than to pass.
We pass.
