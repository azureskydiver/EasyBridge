Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Spades.
====================
North bids 1S.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL3: But we lack the strength for a simple overcall.
B00: We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
South bids 2S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North bids 3S.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Spades.  Declarer is North; East leads.
=======================
PL02: Starting play as left-hand defender.
PLYLEAD: Making opening lead as East against a contract of 3 Spades.
PLYLD4G: We have no 4-card suits other than the trump suit, so lead the 4th best trump -- the S4.   <<<<<<<<< ?????????????
PLYSIG1: Partner discarded low with the six, so consider it a signal that he dislikes the suit.
