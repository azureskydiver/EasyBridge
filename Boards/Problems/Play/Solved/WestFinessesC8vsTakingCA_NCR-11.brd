====================
Opening bid for team.
Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 1H.
--------------------
South bids 2D.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Heart.
REVAL38: (with 4-card Heart trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Clubs,  & a singleton in Diamonds, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 11.0 to 17.0 points)
F01: Partner, opening in third position, is showing 10.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
I08: Have 12.0/11.0/17.0 points with 4-card support for partner's Hearts (holding KQJ4), which is too strong for a limit raise, so we have to temporarily shift to Spades with a bid of 2 Spades.
We bid 2S.

--------------------
South passes.
--------------------

REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...

YR2: With With 30.0-33.0 total points and a openable 6-card Spade suit (holding KJ9764), rebid it at 5 Spades.
