====================
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Have 15.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
This meet the rqmts for the 1NT opening range (15-17), so bid 1NT.
We bid 1NT.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 2C.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 No Trump and partner's response of 2 Clubs.
Partner is using the Stayman convention, asking for majors.
But we have no 4-card majors, so reply negatively to Stayman by bidding 2 Diamonds.
We bid 2D.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 2NT.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
Partner bid Notrump, indicating a dislike for our Diamond suit.
With a total of 23.0-37.0 / 23.0-37.0 pts in the partnership, we lack adequate strength for a further raise beyond partner's 2 No Trump bid, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 No Trump.  Declarer is East; South leads.
