====================
West bids 2S.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL6a: But we don't have a suit strong enough to overcall with at the 3-level.
B00: We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3C.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 3 Clubs.
REVAL38: (with 3-card Club trump support & a doubleton in Diamonds, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 13.0 to 14.0 points)
SHUTR0: Partner made a preemptive 3 Clubs bid, showing a 7-card Club suit with no tricks outside the suit, and most likely 5.0-8.0 points.
SHUTR9: With 13.0/13.0/14.0 points in hand, for a total of 19.0-22.0 points in the partnership, holding T75 in support of partner's Club suit, and with only 3.0 QTs and 6 likely winners, we have no real reason to bid anything, so just pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 3 Clubs.  Declarer is South; West leads.
