8 card major suit fit was there, but EB failed (twice!) to bid it, putting us in an inferior suit.

S:A64  H:983  D:87  C:AQT32
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 10.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 10.0.
  QT's = 2.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  2 Likely Winners (0/-1/0/3)
  11 Likely Losers (3/4/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
South bids 1S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Spade.
Adjusting by 1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Spade trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Diamonds, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 10.0 to 12.0 points)
Partner is showing 12.0-19.0 points and 2+ QT's.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer for Club contract...
2REVAL16: (after re-evaluation for distribution, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 10.0 to 11.0 points)
Have 10.0/10.0/12.0 points (in between single & double raise ranges)  and moderate support for partner's Spade suit (holding A64), but first show our preferred Club suit in a 2 Clubs bid.
We bid 2C.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Spade, 2 Clubs, and 2 Hearts.
Partner bid another suit (third suit in partnership) at 2 Hearts after our 2/1 response, showing 12.0-18.0 points.
(with 3-card Heart trump support & a doubleton in Diamonds, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 10.0 to 11.0 points)
With 3 trumps in partner's first suit (Spades), we prefer to support that suit.
With 23.0-29.0 points in the partnership and 3-card support for partner's major Heart suit (holding 983), raise to 3 Hearts.
We bid 3H.
