***Bidding restarted***
East bids 1S.
--------------------
South bids 3D.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Spade.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL5: Adding 1 point(s) for the 1 extra trump(s).
4REVAL21: Adjusting by 1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 4-card Spade trump support including a trump honor, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 11.0 to 13.0 points)
F00: Partner is showing 12.0-21.0 points and 2+ QT's.
I08: Have 11.0/11.0/13.0 points with 4-card support for partner's Spades (holding AT74), which is too strong for a limit raise, so we have to temporarily shift to Diamonds with a bid of 4 Diamonds.
We bid 4D.  <<<<<<<<<<< NO BAD
