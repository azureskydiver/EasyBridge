East plays too low allowing South to win with HT. East should play high Heart as E-W have HKQJ
>>>>>> EAST <<<<<<<<
S:K843  H:KJ973  D:Q5  C:QJ
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 12.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-2.0;
Total pts = 10.0.
  QT's = 1.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Likely Winners (2/3/0/0)
  8 Likely Losers (2/2/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, Hearts can be opened.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
E07: Have 12.0 points in high cards in 3rd position and a openable Heart suit, so bid 1 Heart.
We bid 1H.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 2H.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Heart and partner's response of 2 Hearts.
RDR0: With a single raise, partner is showing 6.0-10.0 points and decent (3-4 card) support for our Heart suit.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
3REVAL8: Since the trump suit is only topped by a King, deduct 0 points.
2REVAL16: (after re-evaluation for distribution, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 10.0 to 11.0 points)
RDR2: We have a total of 17.0-21.0 points in the partnership, which is not enough for game, so settle for a part score and pass.
We pass.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 Hearts.  Declarer is East; South leads.

PLN10: We have only 7 sure tricks against a requirement of 8 for the 2H contract.
PLNPRI: The Spade suit looks the most promising for further development.
PLSEQ: Checking play sequencing...
PLSEQ6: We want to work on developing the Spade suit first, so move its plays up to the front if possible.
PINTLV: Interleaving plays...
PLN90: The tentative list of available plays is as follows:
------>
 Play 1: Pull a round of trumps with the Queen in dummy.
 Play 2: Pull a round of trumps with the King in hand.
 Play 3: Ruff a Spade in dummy.
 Play 4: Cash the Queen of Spades in dummy.
 Play 5: Cash the King of Spades in hand.
 Play 6: Ruff a Diamond in hand.
 Play 7: Ruff a Diamond in hand.
 Play 8: Lead a low Diamond from dummy and finesse the Queen in hand against South.
 Play 9: Cash the Queen of Clubs in hand.
 Play 10: Cash the Jack of Clubs in hand.
 Play 11: Cash the Ace of Clubs in dummy.
 Play 12: Cash the Queen of Hearts in dummy.
 Play 13: Cash the King of Hearts in hand.
PLN95: The planning is complete.
