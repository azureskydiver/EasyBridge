North should bid 4H over West's 3S
>>> NORTH<<<<<<<<<<<<<
S:9  H:AKT5  D:Q7532  C:A32
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 13.0, Distn pts = 2.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 13.0.
  QT's = 3.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  4 Likely Winners (0/2/2/0)
  9 Likely Losers (1/2/3/3)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
South bids 1H.
--------------------
West bids 3S.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Heart.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL5: Adding 1 point(s) for the 1 extra trump(s).
2REVAL38: (with 4-card Heart trump support including a trump honor & a singleton in Spades, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 13.0 to 18.0 points)
F00: Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
J20: Have 13.0/13.0/18.0 points; show strength by jump shifting to 3 Diamonds, even though it's not the preferred suit.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<???? bid level
But our bid (3 Diamonds) is too low vs. the last bid of of 3 Spades, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Spades.  Declarer is West; North leads.
