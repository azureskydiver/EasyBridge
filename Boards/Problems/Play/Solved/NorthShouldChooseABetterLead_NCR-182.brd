====================
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 1C.
--------------------
South bids 1D.
--------------------
West bids 1S.
--------------------
Responding to partner's  bid of 1 Diamond.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Diamond trump support & a doubleton in Spades, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 5.0 to 6.0 points)
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Diamond suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 13.0-20.0 points.
ROVRC99: We have insufficient strength for either a raise, suit shift, or NT bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 4S.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.

=======================
PL02: Starting play as left-hand defender.
PLYLEAD: Making opening lead as North against a contract of 4 Spades.
PLYLD4: Lead the bottom card of partner's Diamond suit (the three.
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Diamonds.
RCP25: Dummy is shown to be void in Diamonds.
PLDIS12: We do not have a winner in the Club suit, so discard low with the two.
PLDF48: We can't beat West's Queen, so discard the C2.
PLAYDF2: Playing second as defender, using default player logic.
PLDF2H5: Cover with the winner Ace.
PLDF2H3: Cover with the Ace.
PLYLDRT2: We'd like to return partner's Clubs suit, but dummy will most likely win.
PLYLDPRF1: Partner likes the Diamond suit, but dummy can ruff, so skip this suit for now.   <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< YES
PLYLD33: Partner has bid the Diamonds suit, so lead the D6.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<???????????
