====================
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
A00: Have 18.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
A10: This exceeds the max pts for a 1NT opening (17), but is less than min pts for 2NT (20).  So bid the lowest openable suit of 1 Spade for now, then try for a jump shift to 2NT later.
We bid 1S.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Spade and partner's response of 2 Diamonds.
B3W00a: Partner has made a 2 over 1 bid following an earlier pass, Diamonds over Spades, which shows 9.5-11.5 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL38: (with 3-card Diamond trump support including a trump honor, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 17.5 to 18.5 points)
B3W41: With moderate support for partner'sminor Diamond suit (holding K94), and no other good suits, we're forced to rebid our Spades suit at 2 Spades.
We bid 2S.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2NT.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
BXPNTA: Partner bid Notrump, indicating a dislike for our Spade suit.
BXPNTK: With a balanced hand and 27.5-29.5 total HCPs, sign off on partner's 2 No Trump contract.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 No Trump.  Declarer is South; West leads.
