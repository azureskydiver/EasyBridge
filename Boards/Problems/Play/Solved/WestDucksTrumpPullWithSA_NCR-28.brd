We have only 5 sure tricks against a requirement of 8 for the 2S contract.
The Heart suit looks the most promising for further development.
Checking play sequencing...
We want to work on developing the Heart suit first, so move its plays up to the front if possible.
Interleaving plays...
The tentative list of available plays is as follows:
------>
 Play 1: Pull a round of trumps with the King in hand.
 Play 2: Pull a round of trumps with the Ace in dummy.
 Play 3: Ruff a Heart in hand.
 Play 4: Ruff a Heart in hand.
 Play 5: Lead a low Heart from hand and finesse the Queen in dummy against North.
 Play 6: Lead a low Heart from dummy and finesse the King in hand against South.
 Play 7: Cash the King of Hearts in hand.
 Play 8: Cash the Queen of Hearts in dummy.
 Play 9: Ruff a Club in hand.
 Play 10: Ruff a Club in hand.
 Play 11: Ruff a Diamond in dummy.
 Play 12: Lead a low Diamond from dummy and finesse the Queen in hand against South.
 Play 13: Lead a low Diamond from dummy and finesse the King in hand against South.
 Play 14: Play the Queen of Diamonds from hand to force out the opponents' Ace.
 Play 15: Play the Queen of Diamonds from hand to force out the opponents' Jack.
 Play 16: Cash the King of Diamonds in hand.
 Play 17: Cash the Ace of Spades in dummy.
 Play 18: Cash the King of Spades in hand.
The planning is complete.
