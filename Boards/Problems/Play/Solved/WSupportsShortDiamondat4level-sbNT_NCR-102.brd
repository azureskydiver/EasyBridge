[[File Comments]]
I don't believe that West should rebid Diamonds; East opened 1D (short) and West rebid 4D after no agreement of S or Hearts....
==========================================
West analysis:??????????????????????????????????????????
S:AQ94  H:Q4  D:985  C:KQ96
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 13.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.0;
Total pts = 12.0.
  QT's = 2.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  6 Likely Winners (3/0/0/3)
  7 Likely Losers (1/2/3/1)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suits are  Clubs, Spades
The best suit is Spades.
====================
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 1D.
--------------------
South bids 2C.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Diamond.
(with 3-card Diamond trump support & a doubleton in Hearts, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 12.0 to 13.0 points)
Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
Have 13.0/12.0/13.0 points but we prefer to shift instead of raising a minor Diamond suit, so show our own Spade suit by bidding 2 Spades.
We bid 2S.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 3H.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Diamond, 2 Spades, and 3 Hearts.
Partner bid another suit (third suit in partnership) at 3 Hearts after our 2/1 response, showing 12.0-18.0 points.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
Without a compelling suit of our own, we prefer to support partner's first suit of Diamonds.
With 13.0/12.0 points in hand, for a total in the partnership of 24.0-30.0 points, and 3-card support for partner's first suit (Diamonds), return to it by shifting back to 4 Diamonds.
We bid 4D.???????????????????? East never rebid D so probably a short Diamond was originally bid. Since West only has 3 small diamonds, he should not rebid diamonds (unsupported) at the 4 level.... Perhaps NT would be better ????????????????????????????????????
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East passes.

South passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 4 Diamonds.  Declarer is East; South leads.

East Analysis??????????????????????????????????????????
S:T82  H:AKJ8  D:KQ76  C:JT
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 14.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 14.0.
  QT's = 3.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  6 Likely Winners (0/3/3/0)
  7 Likely Losers (3/1/1/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suits are  Diamonds, Hearts
The best suit is Hearts.
====================
North passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Have 14.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Diamond.
We bid 1D.
--------------------
South bids 2C.
--------------------
West bids 2S.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Diamond and partner's response of 2 Spades.
Partner has made a 2 over 1 bid, Spades over Diamonds, which shows 9.5-17.5 points and is forcing for one round.
(with 3-card Spade trump support & a doubleton in Clubs, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 14.0 to 15.0 points)
With weak support for partner's Spade suit (holding T82), and our first suit not rebiddable, we have to shift to another suit at 3 Hearts.
We bid 3H.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 4D.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
Partner has returned to our first suit, raising it to 4 Diamonds.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 5.
2REVAL18: Declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 14.0 down to 13.0 points)
With 22.5-30.5 points in the partnership and no aspirations for a higher contract, we sign off on partner's bid of 4 Diamonds.
We pass.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 4 Diamonds.  Declarer is East; South leads.
