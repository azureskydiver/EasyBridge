Why did N support 2nd bid suit of diamonds (he had only 2) when he had 3 of my first bid suit hearts...???
=========================
S:AQ9876  H:QJ2  D:A4  C:Q5
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 15.0, Distn pts = 3.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.0;
Total pts = 15.0.
  QT's = 2.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  6 Likely Winners (4/1/1/0)
  7 Likely Losers (2/2/1/2)
Playing five-card majors, Spades can be opened.
Have a strong suit in Spades.
Preferred suit is Spades.
====================
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Have 15.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Spade.
We bid 1S.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Spade and partner's response of 2 Hearts.
Partner has made a 2 over 1 bid, Hearts over Spades, which shows 9.5-17.5 points and is forcing for one round.
(with 3-card Heart trump support including a trump honor & doubletons in Clubs and Diamonds, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 15.0 to 16.0 points)
With a rebiddable Spade suit and moderate support for partner's Hearts (holding QJ2), rebid 2 Spades.
We bid 2S.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
YN1: With 25.5-33.5 points in the partnership and 2-card support for partner's  Diamond suit (holding A4), raise to 4 Diamonds.
BXM60: With 2-card support for partner's Diamond suit, raise it to the 4-level at 4 Diamonds.
We bid 4D.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 5D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 4.
We've reached agreement in suits, but with only 25.5-33.5 total points we can't raise partner's 5 Diamonds bid any further, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 5 Diamonds.  Declarer is South; West leads.
