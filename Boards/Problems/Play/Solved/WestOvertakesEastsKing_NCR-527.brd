RWKT: Partner made a weak 2-bid, showing a a 6+ card suit with 5.5-10.5 points, less than 4 cards in the other major, no voids, and no more than one singleton.
We have 15.0/13.5/15.0 points, for a partnership total of 20.5-25.5 points, so we are interested in game if a good fit can be found.
RWKT28: But we don't like partner's Heart suit (holding K), so shift to our preferred Diamond suit in a bid of 3 Diamonds.
We bid 3D.
