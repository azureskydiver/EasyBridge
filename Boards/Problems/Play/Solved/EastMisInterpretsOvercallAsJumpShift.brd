East misinterprets West's overcall as a Jump shift
>>>>>>>>> EAST <<<<<<<<<<<<<<,
S:T62  H:AQ9853  D:K6  C:T4
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 9.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 10.0.
  QT's = 2.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  6 Likely Winners (0/5/1/0)
  7 Likely Losers (3/1/1/2)
Playing five-card majors, Hearts can be opened.
Have a strong suit in Hearts.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
Opening bid for team.
WEAK2: Have a good 6-card Heart suit with 9.0/10.0 points (less than normal opening requirements), so bid a weak 2 Hearts.
--------------------
South bids 3D.
--------------------
West bids 3S.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 2 Hearts and partner's response of 3 Spades.
B3Y00: Partner has made a jump shift to 3 Spades after our opening 2 Hearts bid, which indicates 18.0+ points and is forcing to game (and points to a possible slam).
REVAL38: (with 3-card Spade trump support & doubletons in Clubs and Diamonds, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 10.0 to 11.0 points)
YN1: With 29.0-30.0 points in the partnership and 3-card support for partner's major Spade suit (holding T62), raise to 4 Spades.
--------------------
South passes.

West passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 4 Spades.  Declarer is West; North leads.

Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 7.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-2.0;
Total pts = 5.0.
  QT's = 0.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Likely Winners (3/0/0/2)
  8 Likely Losers (2/2/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, Spades can be opened.
Preferred suit is Spades.
====================
East bids 2H.
--------------------
South bids 3D.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Hearts.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
RWKT: Partner made a weak 2-bid, showing a a 6+ card suit with 5.0-10.0 points, less than 4 cards in the other major, no voids, and no more than one singleton.
RWKT4: We only have 7.0/5.0/5.0 points, for a partnership total of 10.0-15.0 points, which is probably not enough for game.
RWKT8: And we don't like partner's Heart suit (holding 76), so shift to our preferred Spade suit in a bid of 3 Spades.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 4S.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 2 Hearts, 3 Spades, and 4 Spades.
B4H01: Partner raised our Spades after our jump shift, so stick with that suit.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
3REVAL8: Since the trump suit is only topped by a King, deduct 0 points.
2REVAL16: (after re-evaluation for distribution, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 5.0 to 6.0 points)
B4H05: And with 11.0-16.0 pts in the partnership, sign off on partner's bid of 4 Spades.
We pass.

North passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 4 Spades.  Declarer is West; North leads.
