Opening bid for team.
Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.

East bids 1C.
--------------------
South bids 1D.

West bids 1H.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Diamond.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Diamond suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
The total point count in the partnership is therefore 8.5-15.5 points.
This is not enough to bid any higher, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 2H.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 4H.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
