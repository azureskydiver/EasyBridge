Playing five-card majors, Hearts can be opened.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
South bids 1D.
--------------------
West bids 1S.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Spade.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Spade suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 18.5-25.5 points.
ROVRC99: We have insufficient strength for either a raise, suit shift, or NT bid, so pass.   <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< 6Hearts ??????????
We pass.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 1 Spade.  Declarer is West; North leads.
