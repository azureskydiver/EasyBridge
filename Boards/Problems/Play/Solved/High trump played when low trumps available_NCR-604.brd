W, in dummy, followed a KD with a QD, knowing he couldn't take the trick.  Should've burned the 3D.

S:QJ6  H:7652  D:QJ43  C:74
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 6.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.0;

  QT's = 0.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  2 Likely Winners (1/-1/2/0)
  11 Likely Losers (2/5/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
Opening bid for team.
Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 1D.
--------------------
South doubles.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Diamond.
Adjusting by 1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 4-card Diamond trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Clubs, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 5.0 to 8.0 points)
Partner, opening in third position, is showing 10.0-19.0 points and 2+ QT's.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer for Diamond contract...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 5.
3REVAL8: Since the trump suit is only topped by a Queen, deduct 1 points.
2REVAL18: Declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract in Diamonds from 5.0 down to 3.0 points)
Have 6.0/5.0/8.0 points with good support for partner's Diamond suit (holding QJ43) and no good major suits, so raise to 2 Diamonds.
We bid 2D.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 2 Diamonds.  Declarer is East; South leads.
