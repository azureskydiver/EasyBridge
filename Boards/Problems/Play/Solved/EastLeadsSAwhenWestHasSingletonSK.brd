--------------------
Opening bid for team.
A00: Have 14.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.

--------------------
South bids 2S.
--------------------
West bids 3NT.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 No Trump and partner's response of 3 No Trump.
NT10: Partner's raise from our 1 No Trump to 3 No Trump indicates a balanced hand and 9.0-15.0 HCPs, for a total of 23.0+ HCPs in the partnership.
B3N12: But with only about 23.0-29.0 HCPS in the partnership, we don't have enough for game, so pass.
We pass.
