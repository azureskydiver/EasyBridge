Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suits are  Clubs, Spades
The best suit is Spades.
====================
South passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
A00: Have 18.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
A10: This exceeds the max pts for a 1NT opening (17), but is less than min pts for 2NT (20).  So bid the lowest openable suit of 1 Club for now, then try for a jump shift to 2NT later.
We bid 1C.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 2C.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Club and partner's response of 2 Clubs.
RDR0: With a single raise, partner is showing 6.0-10.0 points and decent (3-4 card) support for our Club suit.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 5.
3REVAL8: Since the trump suit is only topped by a King, deduct 0 points.
2REVAL18: Declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 17.0 down to 16.0 points)
R08: Using the modified trick count, we have only 5 playing tricks in hand and a total of 22.0-26.0 points in the partnership, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 Clubs.  Declarer is West; North leads.
