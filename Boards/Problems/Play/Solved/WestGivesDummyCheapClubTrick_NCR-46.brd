PL02: Starting play as left-hand defender.
PLYLEAD: Making opening lead as West against a contract of 2 Spades.
PLYLD4: Lead the singleton H2.
PLDF54: Although we could trump this hand, partner's HA is high, so discard the D5.
RCP5A: West is now known to have started with 1 Heart.
PLDF55: With no cards in Hearts, trump with the S2.
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Hearts.
PLYLD42: With no good card to lead, lead the CJ since the opponents have not shown out of the Club suit.
PLYSIG1: Partner discarded low with the six, so consider it a signal that he dislikes the suit.
PLAYB41: Play the King to win the trick.
PLYLDB: With no other clear plays available, lead a card from the unbid Diamond suit.
