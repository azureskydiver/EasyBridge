***Bidding restarted***
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
A00: Have 15.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
A04: But with an openable 5-card Spade suit, prefer to open in the major instead of in No Trump.
E01: Have 15.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Spade.
We bid 1S.
--------------------
East bids 2H.
--------------------
South bids 3D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Spade and partner's response of 3 Diamonds.
B3W00: Partner has made a 2 over 1 bid, Diamonds over Spades, which shows 11.5-17.5 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Diamond contract...
3REVAL7: Adding 1 point(s) for the solid Spade suit.
4REVAL21: Adjusting by 0 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Diamond trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Hearts, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 14.0 to 16.5 points)
B3W14: With a balanced distribution, approx. 26.5-32.5 HCPs in the partnership, and  a balanced distribution, bid 2 No Trump in preference to partner's minor.
But our bid (2 No Trump) is too low vs. the last bid of of 3 Diamonds, so we have to pass.    <<<<<<<<<<< NT is out. East bid Hearts!!!!
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Diamonds.  Declarer is South; West leads.
