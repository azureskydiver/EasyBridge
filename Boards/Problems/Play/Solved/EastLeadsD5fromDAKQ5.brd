Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Have a powerful suit in Diamonds.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
E03: Have 12.0 points in high cards, 2.0 quick tricks, and a rebiddable suit in Diamonds, so bid 1 Diamond.
We bid 1D.
--------------------
South bids 1H.
--------------------
West bids 1NT.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Diamond and partner's response of 1 No Trump.
B3J00: With a 1NT response, partner is showing 5.5-9.5 points, a lack of good support for our Diamond suit, and no other suit available to bid at an appropriate level.
B3K10: Partner doesn't like our Diamonds, but we don't have another suit we can bid, so rebid the suit at 2 Diamonds.
We bid 2D.
--------------------
South bids 2H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 2 Diamonds and partner's pass.
B3A20: Partner passed, showing < 6 points, so with 12.0/15.5 points in hand and 15.5-20.5 total partnership points, we have no choice but to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 Hearts.  Declarer is South; West leads.
