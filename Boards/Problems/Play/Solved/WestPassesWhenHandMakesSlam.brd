F00: Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
I08: Have 12.0/12.0/15.0 points with 3-card support for partner's Hearts (holding QT2), which is too strong for a limit raise, so we have to temporarily shift to Spades with a bid of 1 Spade.
But our bid is too low vs. the last bid of of 2 Diamonds, so we have to pass.
We pass.
