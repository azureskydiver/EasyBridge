Received hand:
  S:74  H:AQ8  D:AJ84  C:KJ64
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 15.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;

  QT's = 3.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, D, C

Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.

The best suit is Diamonds.
====================
South bids 1D.
--------------------
West passes.

Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Diamond.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL5: Adding 1 point(s) for the 1 extra trump(s).
4REVAL21: Adjusting by 1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 4-card Diamond trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Spades, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 15.0 to 18.0 points)
F00: Partner is showing 12.0-20.5 points and 2+ QT's.
I20: Have 15.0/15.0/18.0 points and strong support for partner's minor Diamond suit (holding AJ84).  Although we'd prefer not to raise a minor, we have no other good options, so raise to 2 Diamonds.
We bid 2D.  <<<<<<<<<<<<< NO TOO WEAK a response
