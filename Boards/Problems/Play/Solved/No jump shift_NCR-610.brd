North is too passive !  17HCP plus a viod is enough for a jump shift !

North's analysis:

South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Have 17.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Spade.
We bid 1S.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1NT.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Spade and partner's response of 1 No Trump.
With a 1NT response, partner is showing 6.0-10.0 points, a lack of good support for our Spade suit, and no other suit available to bid at an appropriate level.
Since partner doesn't like our Spades, try 2 Diamonds.
We bid 2D.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 2 Diamonds.  Declarer is North; East leads.
