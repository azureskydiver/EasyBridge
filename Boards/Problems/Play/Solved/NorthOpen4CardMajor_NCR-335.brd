N opened 4 card (weak) major Hearts
===================
S:K75  H:AT53  D:AQ3  C:KQ3
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 18.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 18.0.
  QT's = 4.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  3 Likely Winners (0/1/1/1)
  10 Likely Losers (3/3/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Have 18.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
This exceeds the max pts for a 1NT opening (17), but is less than min pts for 2NT (22).  So bid the lowest openable suit of 1 Heart for now, then try for a jump shift to 2NT later.
We bid 1H.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< HOW ABOUT Convenient Minor here?????????/
--------------------
East bids 1S.
--------------------
South bids 2H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Heart and partner's response of 2 Hearts.
With a single raise, partner is showing 10.0-12.0 points and decent (3-4 card) support for our Heart suit.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 5.
2REVAL18: Declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract in Hearts from 18.0 down to 16.0 points)
We have a total of 26.0-28.0 points in the partnership, which should be enough for game, so jump to 4 Hearts.
We bid 4H.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 4 Hearts.  Declarer is North; East leads.
