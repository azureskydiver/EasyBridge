East should bid Spades with this hand
>>>>>> EAST <<<<<<<<<
S:AJT76432  H:T7  D:87  C:4
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 5.0, Distn pts = 9.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 10.0.
  QT's = 1.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S
  Probable Stoppers in:
  6 Likely Winners (6/0/0/0)
  7 Likely Losers (2/2/2/1)
Playing five-card majors, Spades can be opened.
Have a strong suit in Spades.
Preferred suit is Spades.
====================
West bids 1H.
--------------------
North bids 2C.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Heart.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
F00: Partner is showing 12.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
G3: Have 5.0/10.0/10.0 points with poor (T7) support for partner's Heart suit but hold a strong 8-card Spade suit, so bid 1 Spade instead.  <<<<<<<<<< NEED 2 Spades
But our bid (1 Spade) is too low vs. the last bid of of 2 Clubs, so we have to pass.
We pass.
