[[File Comments]]
The bidding here was a normal 1C opening by West, normal overcall of 1S by North, and a normal negative double by East. 
 At this point as South I threw in an unjustified redouble (I do not expect EasyBridge to understand Rosenkranz redoubles). 
 West decides he has no good bid, so passes (maybe he should bid 2C), North doesn’t understand the redouble, so passes.  
At this point East gets amnesia, he forgets that West opened the bidding and figures West has less than 6 points so he passes ! 
 (Of course, he should simply bid 2C with 4 clubs to the ace, since East didn’t get excited by the promised Heart suit.) 
 North/South have stolen a game at 1Sxx (which was a minor scramble to make).
 
I think the major problem this shows is that East got amnesia during the bidding.
