[[File Comments]]
I don't agree with West's 3S bid. 
The analysis says:
"With 23.0-24.0 points in the partnership and 3-card support for partner's major Spade suit (holding T63), raise to 3 Spades.
We bid 3S."

West really should pass with only 6 points, no distribution and only three-card support for a non-rebid spade suit. 
In play, 3S goes three down.

West:
S:T63  H:KQT  D:JT83  C:T54
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 6.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.0;
Total pts = 5.0.
  QT's = 1.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: H
  Probable Stoppers in:
  0 Likely Winners (-1/1/1/-1)
  13 Likely Losers (4/2/3/4)
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
Opening bid for team.
Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.

Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Spade.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 4.
Partner, opening in third position, is showing 10.0-21.5 points and 2+ QT's.
