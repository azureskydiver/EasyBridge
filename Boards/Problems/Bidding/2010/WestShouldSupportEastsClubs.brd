Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 9.0, Distn pts = 3.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.0;
Total pts = 8.0.
  QT's = 1.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  6 Likely Winners (0/0/3/3)
  7 Likely Losers (1/2/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suits are  Clubs, Diamonds
The best suit is Diamonds.

Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Club.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL5: Adding 3 point(s) for the 2 extra trump(s).
2REVAL38: (with 5-card Club trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Hearts,  & a singleton in Spades, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 8.0 to 14.0 points)
F01: Partner, opening in third position, is showing 10.0+ points and 2+ QT's.
I14: Have 9.0/8.0/14.0 points but we prefer to shift instead of raising a minor Club suit, so show our own Diamond suit by bidding 4 Diamonds. <<<<<????
