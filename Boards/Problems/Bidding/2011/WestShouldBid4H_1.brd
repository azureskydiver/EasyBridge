====================
South bids 1D.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCTK: With 17.0/22.0 points, the hand is too strong for a simple overcall, so start by doubling.
We bid Dbl.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 1S.
--------------------
South bids 2D.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of Double and partner's response of 1 Spade.
TKORb43: Partner has made a minimum response of 1 Spade, indicating no more than 9 points.
TKRb49: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 24.0-31.0 pts.
TKRb51: The right-hand opponent has bid after partner's response, interfering with our communication.
TKRb90: Partner's forced response of 1 Spade not withstanding, we can now show the Heart suit that we wanted to overcall with last round by bidding 3 Hearts.   <<<<<<<<< 4H is there
We bid 3H.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 3 Hearts.  Declarer is West; North leads.
