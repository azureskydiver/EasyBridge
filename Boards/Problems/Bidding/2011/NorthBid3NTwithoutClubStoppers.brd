====================
South bids 1H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Heart.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
F00: Partner is showing 12.0-21.5 points and 2+ QT's.
G3: Have 8.0/8.0/8.0 points with poor (5) support for partner's Heart suit but hold a openable 6-card Spade suit, so bid 1 Spade instead.
We bid 1S.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Heart, 1 Spade, and 3 Hearts.
B4D0: Partner made a jump rebid of his Heart suit to 3 Hearts, showing 17.0-21.5 points.
B4D19a: We have 25.0-29.5 pts in the partnership, which is enough for game, but there is no suit agreement -- so we're forced to bid 3 No Trump.
We bid 3NT.
