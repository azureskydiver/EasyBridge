Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 14.0, Distn pts = 2.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 14.0.
  QT's = 3.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Likely Winners (0/0/1/4)
  8 Likely Losers (3/1/3/1)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Have a strong suit in Clubs.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
West bids 2H.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
But we don't have a suit strong enough to overcall with at the 3-level.
With 14.0/14.0 points and support for all unbid suits, bid a takeout double.
We bid Dbl.
--------------------
East passes.

South bids 2S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of Double and partner's response of 2 Spades.
Partner has made a minimum response of 2 Spades, indicating no more than 9 points.
The total point count in the partnership is therefore 16.0-23.0 pts.
With a total of 16.0-23.0 points in the partnership, we have insufficient strength to raise partner's 2 Spades bid, so we have to pass.
We pass.

East passes.
