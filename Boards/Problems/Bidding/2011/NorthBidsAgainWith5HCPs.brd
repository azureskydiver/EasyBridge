====================
South bids 1C.
--------------------
West doubles.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Club.
Adjusting by 1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Club trump support including a trump honor & doubletons in Diamonds and Hearts, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 4.0 to 5.0 points)
Partner is showing 12.0-20.0 points and 2+ QT's.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
3REVAL5: Adding 1 point(s) for the 1 extra trump(s).
3REVAL8: Since the trump suit is only topped by a ten, deduct 3 points.
Have 5.0/4.0/5.0 pts with an available 6-card major suit in Spades (T87654), so bid 1 Spade over partner's minor suit 1 Club bid.
We bid 1S.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2NT.
--------------------
West doubles.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Club, 1 Spade, and 2 No Trump.
Partner's jump shift from our 1 Spade bid to 2 No Trump indicates a balanced hand and 17.0+ points, for a total of 21.0+ points in the partnership, and is forcing to game.
With With 21.0-23.0 total points and a openable 6-card Spade suit (holding T87654), rebid it at 3 Spades.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< ?????
We bid 3S.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3NT.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
Partner bid Notrump, indicating a dislike for our Spade suit.
With a total of 22.0-24.0 / 21.0-23.0 pts in the partnership, we lack adequate strength for a further raise beyond partner's 3 No Trump bid, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 No Trump.  Declarer is South; West leads.
