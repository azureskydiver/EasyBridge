Opening bid for team.
Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 1D.
--------------------
South bids 1H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Heart.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Heart contract...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Heart suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.  <<<<<<<<<< ASSUMES worst
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 17.5-24.5 points.
ROVRC99: We have insufficient strength for either a raise, suit shift, or NT bid, so pass.  ????????????????????
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 1 Heart.  Declarer is South; West leads.
