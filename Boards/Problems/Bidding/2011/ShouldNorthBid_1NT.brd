  Sure Stoppers in: S, D, C

  10 Likely Losers (1/4/3/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
E04: Have 12.0 points in high cards, 2.5 quick tricks, and a 5-card suit, so bid 1 Diamond.
We bid 1D.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Diamond and partner's response of 1 Spade.
B3U00: Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid, Spades over Diamonds, which shows 5.5-17.5 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
B3U34: With a balanced distribution and weak support for partner's Spade suit (holding K8), bid 1 No Trump. >>><<<<<<<<<< Weak Hearts ????????
We bid 1NT.
