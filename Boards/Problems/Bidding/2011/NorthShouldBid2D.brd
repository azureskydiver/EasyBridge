4REVAL21: Adjusting by 1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 4-card Diamond trump support including a trump honor & a singleton in Clubs, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 4.0 to 9.0 points)
F01: Partner, opening in third position, is showing 10.0-21.5 points and 2+ QT's.
F04: But we have only 5.0/4.0/9.0 points against a minor suit bid, so we prefer to pass.   <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<  ???? Hand makes 5D
We pass.
