>>>>>>>>>> NORTH<<<<<<<<<<
S:AJ53  H:KT5  D:K76  C:K97
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 14.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 14.0.
  QT's = 2.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  2 Likely Winners (2/0/0/0)
  11 Likely Losers (2/3/3/3)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Spades.
====================
West bids 1D.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL3: But we lack the strength with 14.0 pts for a simple overcall.
TKOUT: With 14.0/14.0 points and support for all unbid suits, bid a takeout double.
We bid Dbl.
--------------------
East bids 1H.
--------------------
South bids 1S.
--------------------
West bids 2H.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of Double and partner's response of 1 Spade.
TKORb42: Partner has made a jump/freebid response of 1 Spade, indicating 10-12 pts and a 4-5 card suit.
TKRb49: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 23.5-26.0 pts.
TKRb51: The right-hand opponent has bid after partner's response, interfering with our communication.
YN1: With 23.5-26.0 points in the partnership and 4-card support for partner's major Spade suit (holding AJ53), raise to 4 Spades. <<<<<<<<<<< ?????
TKRb71a: (we can assume partner has some strength in the Spade suit, so we are shading the requirements slightly.
We bid 4S.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 4 Spades.  Declarer is South; West leads.

RESULT: North/South were set 2 tricks.
