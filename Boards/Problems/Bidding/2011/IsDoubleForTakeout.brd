====================
West bids 1S.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL3: But we lack the strength with 1.5 pts for a simple overcall.
B00: We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 1NT.
--------------------
South bids 2C.
--------------------
West bids 2NT.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Clubs.
ROVRC5: Partner overcalled at the 2-level, indicating a good 5+ card Club suit, 9.5-14.5 points, and probably 6+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 11.0-16.0 points.
ROVRC10: This is not enough to bid any higher, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.

--------------------
A02: Responding to partner's  double.
TKOTR: Partner has doubled for takeout.  <<<<<<<<  Is this a TKO Dbl
TKOTR8: Partner's takeout indicates 11.5+ HCPs, for a total in the partnership of 13.0-23.0 points.
TKOTR22: With 3.0/1.5 pts, respond with our longest suit of Spades at a bid of 3 Spades.
We bid 3S.
