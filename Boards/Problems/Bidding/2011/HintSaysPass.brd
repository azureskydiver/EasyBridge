Hint says for South to pass with 16 HCPs ???
>>>>>>> SOUTH<<<<<<<<<
S:K42  H:AQ4  D:AJ87  C:QT4
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 16.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 16.0.
  QT's = 3.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  3 Likely Winners (0/1/2/0)
  10 Likely Losers (3/2/2/3)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
West bids 1S.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL3: But we lack the strength with 16.0 pts for a simple overcall.   <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<?????????
A00: Have 16.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
A08: This meet the rqmts for the 1NT opening range (15-17), so bid 1NT.
