>>>>>>>>>> NORTH<<<<<<<<<
S:32  H:Q64  D:AT732  C:AQJ
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 13.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;

  QT's = 2.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  4 Likely Winners (0/0/2/2)
  9 Likely Losers (2/3/3/1)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
East bids 3C.
--------------------
South bids 3D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 3 Diamonds.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL5: Adding 3 point(s) for the 2 extra trump(s).
4REVAL21: Adjusting by 1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 5-card Diamond trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Spades, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 13.0 to 18.0 points)
F00: Partner is showing 12.0-21.5 points and 2+ QT's.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
2REVAL16: (after re-evaluation for distribution, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 13.0 to 14.0 points)
I08: Have 13.0/13.0/18.0 points with 5-card support for partner's Diamonds (holding AT732), which is too strong for a limit raise, so we have to temporarily shift to Clubs with a bid of 4 Clubs.  <<<<<<<<???
We bid 4C.
