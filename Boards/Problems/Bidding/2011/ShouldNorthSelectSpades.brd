The best suit is Clubs.
====================
West bids 1C.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL3: But we lack the strength with 3.0 pts for a simple overcall.
B00: We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 1NT.
--------------------
South bids 2S.
--------------------
West bids 2NT.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Spades.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
ROVRC5: Partner overcalled at the 2-level, indicating a good 5+ card Spade suit, 9.5-14.5 points, and probably 6+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 12.5-17.5 points.
ROVRC10: This is not enough to bid any higher, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 2 Spades, Pass, and 3 Hearts.
B4P04: Partner bid another suit (third suit in partnership) at 3 Hearts after our Pass response, showing 12.0-18.0 points.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
PKF6: Without a compelling suit of our own, and with lackluster support for partner's two suits, we prefer to play in No Trumps.
B4P10: With only 5.0/3.0 points in hand, for a total in the partnership of 15.0-21.0 points, we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Hearts.  Declarer is South; West leads.
