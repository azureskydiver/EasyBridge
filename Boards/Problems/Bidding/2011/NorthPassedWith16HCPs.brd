A00: Have 16.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
B00: We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.

REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
ROVRC5: Partner overcalled at the 2-level, indicating a good 5+ card Diamond suit, 9.5-14.5 points, and probably 6+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 25.0-30.0 points.
ROVRC99: We have insufficient strength for either a raise, suit shift, or NT bid, so pass.   <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< 3NT ???????
