North should not have bid 3NT without stoppers in other suits
=======================================
North analysis
S:J7  H:AQ2  D:9652  C:9653
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 7.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-0.5;
Total pts = 6.5.
  QT's = 1.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: H
  Probable Stoppers in:
  -1 Likely Winners (0/1/-1/-1)
  14 Likely Losers (2/2/5/5)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suits are  Diamonds, Clubs
The best suit is Hearts.
====================
South bids 2S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Spades.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Spade contract...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
Partner made a strong 2-bid, showing a very good suit or two solid suits, 9+ playing tricks, and 4+ quick tricks.  We have to respond positively if interested in slam, or negatively otherwise.
We have 1.5 QT's, so we can make a positive response.
But we lack good support for partner's Spade suit (holding J7) with a balanced hand, so jump to 3 No Trump.
We bid 3NT.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 7NT.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 2 Spades, 3 No Trump, and 7 No Trump.
Partner's raise from our 3 No Trump to 7 No Trump indicates a balanced hand and 29.0-33.0 HCPs, for a total of 36.0+ HCPs in the partnership.
With 36.0+ total partnership points, sign off on partner's slam bid of 7 No Trump and pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 7 No Trump.  Declarer is North; East leads.

Rebidding as responder after bids of 2 Spades, 3 No Trump, and 4 No Trump.
Partner's raise from our 3 No Trump to 4 No Trump indicates a balanced hand and 23.0-24.0 HCPs, for a total of 30.0+ HCPs in the partnership and is invitational to slam.
With 30.0-31.0 total HCPs in the partnership, we don't have quite enough for a slam, so we have to decline partner's invitation and pass.
We pass.
