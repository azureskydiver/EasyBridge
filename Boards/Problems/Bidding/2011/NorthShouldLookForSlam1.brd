2REVAL38: (with 4-card Diamond trump support including a trump honor & a singleton in Hearts, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 18.0 to 24.0 points)
B3U86: With 4-card support for partner's minor Diamonds suit (holding QT73), no rebiddable suit or second suit of our own, and 18.0/18.0/24.0 points (for a total of 29.5-41.5 points in the partnership), raise to game at 5 Diamonds.
We bid 5D.

3REVAL6: Deducting 1 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 5.
3REVAL8: Since the trump suit is only topped by a Queen, deduct 1 points.
BXM81: We've reached agreement in suits, but with only 23.5-35.5 total points we can't raise partner's 6 Diamonds bid any further, so pass.
We pass.
