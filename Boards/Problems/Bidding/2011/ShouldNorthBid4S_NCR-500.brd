  QT's = 2.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, D

Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
E03: Have 12.0 points in high cards, 2.0 quick tricks, and a rebiddable suit in Diamonds, so bid 1 Diamond.
We bid 1D.
--------------------
East bids 3C.
--------------------
South bids 3S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Diamond and partner's response of 3 Spades.
B3W00: Partner has made a 2 over 1 bid, Spades over Diamonds, which shows 9.5-17.5 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL5: Adding 1 point(s) for the 1 extra trump(s).
4REVAL21: Adjusting by -1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 4-card Spade trump support including a trump honor & doubletons in Clubs and Hearts, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 11.0 to 13.0 points)
B3W10: With 4-card support for partner's Spades (holding K842) and 12.0/11.0/13.0 points (for a total of 22.5-30.5 points in the partnership), raise to 3 Spades.
But 3 Spades has already been bid, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Spades.  Declarer is South; West leads.
