REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Diamond suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 21.5-28.5 points.
ROVRC99: We have insufficient strength for either a raise, suit shift, or NT bid, so pass.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<???????????? 14 HCPs
