Hint suggests pass wiht 18 HCPs and 4 Dist pts
>>>>>>>>> SOUTH<<<<<<<<<
S:K75  H:AKJ2  D:AK8642  C:64
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 18.0, Distn pts = 4.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 19.0.
  QT's = 4.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  7 Likely Winners (0/3/4/0)
  6 Likely Losers (3/1/2/0)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Have a strong suit in Diamonds.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
Opening bid for team.
E01: Have 18.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Diamond.
We bid 1D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North bids 1NT.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Diamond and partner's response of 1 No Trump.
B3J00: With a 1NT response, partner is showing 5.5-9.5 points, a lack of good support for our Diamond suit, and no other suit available to bid at an appropriate level.
B3K27: Since partner doesn't like our Diamonds, and we don't have another bid, pass   <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< NO
