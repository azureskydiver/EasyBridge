Can West bid 2NT without Diamonds Stopped???
>>>>>>>>> WEST<<<<<<<,
S:AT  H:A8765  D:T5  C:KJ93
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 12.0, Distn pts = 2.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 12.0.
  QT's = 2.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Likely Winners (1/2/0/2)
  8 Likely Losers (1/3/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, Hearts can be opened.
Preferred suits are  Clubs, Hearts
The best suit is Hearts.
====================
Opening bid for team.
Have 12.0 points in high cards and 2.5 quick tricks, so bid 1 Heart.
We bid 1H.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 1S.
--------------------
South bids 2H.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Heart and partner's response of 1 Spade.
Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid, Spades over Hearts, which shows 5.0-17.0 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
With weak support for partner's Spades (holding AT), and no other available bid, bid 2 No Trump.
We bid 2NT.
--------------------
North bids 3H.
--------------------
East passes.
