[[File Comments]]
What happened ?  Bidding 3 card suits again.

If East feels he must bid over the weak jump overcall (and I’m not sure it’s a good idea with only 10 points, no major, and a flat hand) then I would favor 3 clubs.  Avoid misleading partner if at all possible even if the club opener was a short club.  As it is the 2H choice led to a bad result (down 3 doubled).
