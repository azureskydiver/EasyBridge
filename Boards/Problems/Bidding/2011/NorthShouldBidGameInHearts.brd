>>>>>>>>>>>> NORTH<<<<<<,,
S:AJT854  H:K8762  D:K4  C:
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 11.0, Distn pts = 5.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 12.0.
  QT's = 2.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  7 Likely Winners (4/2/1/0)
  6 Likely Losers (2/3/1/0)
Playing five-card majors, both majors qualify for opening.
Have a strong suit in Spades.
Preferred suit is Spades.
====================
South bids 2H.
--------------------
West doubles.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Hearts.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Heart contract...
3REVAL5: Adding 3 point(s) for the 2 extra trump(s).
2REVAL38: (with 5-card Heart trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Diamonds,  & a void in Clubs, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 12.0 to 20.0 points)   <<<<<<<<<<< NOTE 20 PTS !!!!!!!!
RWKT: Partner made a weak 2-bid, showing a a 6+ card suit with 5.5-10.5 points, less than 4 cards in the other major, no voids, and no more than one singleton.
RWKT4: We only have 11.0/12.0/11.0 points, for a partnership total of 16.5-21.5 points, which is probably not enough for game.
RWKT6: And with at least minimum (5-card) support for partner's Hearts (holding K8762), make a weak shutout raise of 3 Hearts.  <<<<<<4H???????
We bid 3H.
