====================
South bids 1H.
--------------------
West bids 2S.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Heart.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Heart contract...
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Heart trump support & a doubleton in Clubs, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 13.0 to 14.0 points)
F00: Partner is showing 12.0-20.5 points and 2+ QT's.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer for Spade contract...
2REVAL16: (after re-evaluation for distribution, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 13.0 to 14.0 points)
I08: Have 13.0/13.0/14.0 points with 3-card support for partner's Hearts (holding T63), which is too strong for a limit raise, so we have to temporarily shift to Spades with a bid of 3 Spades.
We bid 3S.
