====================
South bids 2H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Hearts.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Heart contract...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
RWKT: Partner made a weak 2-bid, showing a a 6+ card suit with 5.5-10.5 points, less than 4 cards in the other major, no voids, and no more than one singleton.
We have 17.0/17.0/17.0 points, for a partnership total of 22.5-27.5 points, so we are interested in game if a good fit can be found.
RWKT32: We have very poor support for partner's Heart (holding 9), and no good suit of our own, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 2 Hearts.  Declarer is South; West leads.
