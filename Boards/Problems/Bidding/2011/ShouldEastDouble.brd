S:K92  H:A85  D:T76  C:AK97
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 14.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0; Total pts = 14.0.
  QT's = 3.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  1 Likely Winners (0/0/-1/2)
  12 Likely Losers (3/3/4/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
South bids 1C.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North bids 1S.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL3: But we lack the strength with 14.0 pts for a simple overcall.
TKOUT: With 14.0/14.0 points and support for all unbid suits, bid a takeout double.
We bid Dbl.
--------------------
South bids 2S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North bids 3S.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of Double and partner's pass.
TKOUT: With 14.0/14.0 points and support for all unbid suits, bid a takeout double again.  ???????? At 3 level after last pass by pard
We bid Dbl.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 4H.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of Double and partner's response of 4 Hearts.
TKORb43: Partner has made a minimum response of 4 Hearts, indicating no more than 9 points.
TKRb49: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 16.0-23.0 pts.
TKRb72: With a total of 16.0-23.0 points in the partnership, we have insufficient strength to raise partner's 4 Hearts bid, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
South doubles.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
We passed and partner passed, so pass again.
We pass.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 4 Hearts (doubled).  Declarer is West; North leads.
