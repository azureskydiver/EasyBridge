====================
West bids 1D.
--------------------
North bids 1S.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Spade.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer for Spade contract...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 5.
2REVAL18: Declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract in Spades from 15.0 down to 11.0 points)
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Spade suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 18.5-25.5 points.
YN1: With 18.5-25.5 points in the partnership and 3-card support for partner's major Spade suit (holding K74), raise to 2 Spades.  <<<<<<<<  HEARTS???
