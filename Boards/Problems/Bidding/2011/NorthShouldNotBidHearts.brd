Responding to partner's opening bid of 3 Spades.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
F00: Partner is showing 12.0-20.5 points and 2+ QT's.
I12: Have 13.0/13.0/13.0 points but insufficient trump support (holding 5) for a double raise, so show our own Heart suit by bidding 4 Hearts.
We bid 4H.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< NO East has 7 Hearts
