[[File Comments]]
With 17 HCPs North could bid 3NT 
>>>>>>>> NORTH<<<<<<<<<<<
South bids 2D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Diamonds.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
RWKT: Partner made a weak 2-bid, showing a a 6+ card suit with 5.5-10.5 points, less than 4 cards in the other major, no voids, and no more than one singleton.
We have 17.0/16.5/17.0 points, for a partnership total of 22.5-27.5 points, so we are interested in game if a good fit can be found.
RWKT32: We have very poor support for partner's Diamond (holding J), and no good suit of our own, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 Diamonds.  Declarer is South; West leads.
=======================
PLAY: West leads the C5.
