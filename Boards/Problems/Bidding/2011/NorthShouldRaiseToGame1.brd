3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
SHUTR0: Partner made a preemptive 3 Diamonds bid, showing a 7-card Diamond suit with no tricks outside the suit, and most likely 5.5-8.5 points.
SHUTR9: With 18.0/17.5/17.5 points in hand, for a total of 23.0-26.0 points in the partnership, holding KJ in support of partner's Diamond suit, and with only 4.0 QTs and 6 likely winners, we have no real reason to bid anything, so just pass.
We pass.
