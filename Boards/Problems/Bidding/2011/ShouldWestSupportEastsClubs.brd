Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 12.0, Distn pts = 2.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.5; Total pts = 10.5.
  QT's = 1.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  4 Likely Winners (0/1/1/2)
  9 Likely Losers (1/3/3/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
South bids 1D.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL3: But we lack the strength with 10.5 pts for a simple overcall.
B00: We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 2C.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Clubs.
ROVRC5: Partner overcalled at the 2-level, indicating a good 5+ card Club suit, 9.5-14.5 points, and probably 6+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 20.0-25.0 points.
ROVRC99: We have insufficient strength for either a raise, suit shift, or NT bid, so pass.  <<<<<<< NO bid with 12HCPs
We pass.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 Clubs.  Declarer is East; South leads.

RCP5A: South is now known to have started with 0 Clubs.
RCP20: Dummy is now out of Spades.
RCP5A: North is now known to have started with 3 Spades.
