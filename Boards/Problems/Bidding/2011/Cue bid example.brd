A hand suitable for a cue bid
Just after I said the cue bid examples are rare, another one came up.  Here, without a cue bid available, the best South can do over the opening 1H by East is a takeout double.  When North answers 1NT, South has to guess about the best contract.  North has no idea of the playing strength of South’s hand, and tends to pass any bid that South makes.  However, a cue bid by South  of 2H over the opening 1H conveys the strength immediately, and N-S may have a chance to get to their slam of 6S.  (Some people don’t treat the immediate cue bid as a game force, but I prefer it that way.)

***Bidding restarted***
Opening bid for team.
Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.

East bids 1H.

South bids 2H.  <>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Cue bid!!!!!!!!!!!

West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Hearts.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Heart contract...
4REVAL21: Adjusting by 1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Heart trump support including a trump honor, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 7.0 to 8.0 points)
ROVRC5: Partner overcalled at the 2-level, indicating a good 5+ card Heart suit, 9.5-14.5 points, and probably 6+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 17.5-22.5 points.
ROVRC20: This is insufficient to raise partner, so pass.
We pass.

East passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 2 Hearts.  Declarer is South; West leads.
