South bids 4S.

West passes.

Responding to partner's opening bid of 4 Spades.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Spade contract...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
Partner made a preemptive 4 Spades bid, showing a 8-card Spade suit with no tricks outside the suit, and most likely 5.5-8.5 points.
With 15.0/14.0/14.0 points in hand, for a total of 19.5-22.5 points in the partnership, holding Q in support of partner's Spade suit, and with only 3.0 QTs and 6 likely winners, we have no real reason to bid anything, so just pass.
We pass.
