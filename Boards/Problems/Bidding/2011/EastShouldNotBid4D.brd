North bids 1D.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL6: But we don't have a sufficiently strong overcall suit.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< NOTE
B00: We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
South bids 1NT.
--------------------
West bids 2S.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Spades.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 6 point(s) for the 3 trump(s) short of 3.
ROVRC5: Partner overcalled at the 2-level, indicating a good 5+ card Spade suit, 9.5-14.5 points, and probably 6+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 21.5-26.5 points.
ROVRC24: With a 6-card Diamond suit, we bid it in preference to partner's Spades at a bid of 3 Diamonds.
We bid 3D.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 3S.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 2 Spades, 3 Diamonds, and 3 Spades.
B4C4: Partner made a minimum rebid of his Spade suit at 3 Spades, showing 10.0-16.0 points and 5+ trump cards.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
3REVAL5: Adding 1 point(s) for the 1 extra trump(s).
3REVAL8: Since the trump suit is only topped by a Jack, deduct 2 points.
2REVAL10: (with a 6-card trump suit in Diamonds, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 12.0 to 14.0 points)
B4C21: with a total of 22.0-28.0 pts in the partnership, rebid our suit 4 Diamonds.  <<<<<<<<<<< 4 Level.   ??? North openned Diamonds!!!
We bid 4D.
