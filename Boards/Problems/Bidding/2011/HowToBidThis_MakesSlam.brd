Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Diamond, 2 Spades, and 4 Diamonds.
B4D0: Partner made a jump rebid of his Diamond suit to 4 Diamonds, showing 17.0-20.0 points.
B4D20: With 14.0/14.0/14.0 pts in hand, for a total in the partnership of 31.0-34.0 pts, we have the points to make game or possibly slam, but so far with no agreed on suit.
YR4: Rebid the next best suit of Clubs in a bid of 5 Clubs.
B4D68: We have 14.0/14.0 pts in hand but no good fit with partner and no rebiddable suit, so we have no choice but to shift to yet another suit.
We bid 5C. <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<????
