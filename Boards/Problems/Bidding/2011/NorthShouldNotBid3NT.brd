Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 13.0, Distn pts = 2.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.5;
Total pts = 11.5.
  QT's = 2.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  4 Likely Winners (0/-1/4/1)
  9 Likely Losers (1/4/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
Opening bid for team.
E02: Have 13.0 points in high cards and 2.0 quick tricks, so bid 1 Diamond.
We bid 1D.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1S.
--------------------
West doubles.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Diamond and partner's response of 1 Spade.
B3U00: Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid, Spades over Diamonds, which shows 5.5-17.5 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Spade contract...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
B3U22: With a rebiddable Diamond suit and insufficient support for partner's Spades (holding K), rebid at 2 Diamonds.
We bid 2D.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2H.
--------------------
West doubles.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
BXM70: Partner switched suits again, which forces us to bid again -- so with no other good options, bid 3 No Trump.
We bid 3NT.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 No Trump.  Declarer is North; East leads.
