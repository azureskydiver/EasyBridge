>>>>NORTH<<<<<<<
=====================================
Received hand:
  S:AT86  H:J9  D:AT863  C:QT
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 11.0, Distn pts = 2.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-0.5;
Total pts = 10.5.
  QT's = 2.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  3 Likely Winners (1/0/2/0)
  10 Likely Losers (3/2/3/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suits are  Diamonds, Spades
The best suit is Diamonds.
====================
East bids 1C.
--------------------
South bids 1H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Heart.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Heart suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 18.0-25.0 points.
ROVRC99: We have insufficient strength for either a raise, suit shift, or NT bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 1 Heart.  Declarer is South; West leads.
