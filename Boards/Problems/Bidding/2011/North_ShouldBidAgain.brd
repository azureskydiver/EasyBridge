Playing five-card majors, Hearts can be opened.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
E04: Have 12.0 points in high cards, 2.5 quick tricks, and a 5-card suit, so bid 1 Heart.
We bid 1H.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2C.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Heart and partner's response of 2 Clubs.
B3W00: Partner has made a 2 over 1 bid, Clubs over Hearts, which shows 9.5-17.5 points and is forcing for one round.<<<<<<
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Club contract...
4REVAL21: Adjusting by 0 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
RevV0: We'd like to bid the Spade suit, but we can't reverse with less than 17 points.
RevV2: And since the 3rd best suit (Clubs) is not strong enough to bid, we have to rebid the original Heart suit.
B3W42: But with only about 21.5-29.5 HCPS in the partnership, we don't have enough for game, so pass.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<???
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
