SHUTR0: Partner made a preemptive 3 Hearts bid, showing a 7-card Heart suit with no tricks outside the suit, and most likely 5.5-8.5 points.
SHUTR9: With 16.0/15.0/17.0 points in hand, for a total of 22.5-25.5 points in the partnership, holding AQ97 in support of partner's Heart suit, and with only 3.5 QTs and 3 likely winners, we have no real reason to bid anything, so just pass.
