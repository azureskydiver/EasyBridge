>>>>>>> NORTH<<<<<<<
=====================================
Received hand:
  S:74  H:K2  D:Q93  C:AKQT54
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 14.0, Distn pts = 3.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 15.0.
  QT's = 2.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  7 Likely Winners (0/1/0/6)
  6 Likely Losers (2/1/3/0)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Have a powerful suit in Clubs.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
E01: Have 14.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Club.
We bid 1C.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Club and partner's response of 1 Heart.
B3U00: Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid, Hearts over Clubs, which shows 5.5-17.5 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Heart contract...
3REVAL7: Adding 3 point(s) for the solid Club suit.
3REVAL5: Adding 1 point(s) for the -1 extra trump(s).
RevV0: We'd like to bid the Diamond suit, but we can't reverse with less than 17 points.
RevV2: And since the 3rd best suit (Spades) is not strong enough to bid, we have to rebid the original Club suit.
B3U18a: With poor support for partner's Heart suit (holding K2), and no other suit available to bid, rebid the Club suit at 2 Clubs.
We bid 2C.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
BXM70: Partner switched suits again, which forces us to bid again -- so with no other good options, bid 3 No Trump. <<<<<<<<<<<
We bid 3NT.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 No Trump.  Declarer is North; East leads.

RESULT: North/South were set 4 tricks.
