Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Spades.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Spade contract...
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Spade trump support & a singleton in Clubs, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 14.0 to 16.0 points)
RWKT: Partner made a weak 2-bid, showing a a 6+ card suit with 5.5-10.5 points, less than 4 cards in the other major, no voids, and no more than one singleton.
We have 14.0/14.0/14.0 points, for a partnership total of 19.5-24.5 points, so we are interested in game if a good fit can be found.
RWKT21: And we like partner's Spade suit (holding 876 support), but with only 19.5-24.5 total pts we don't quite have enough for a direct game bid, so invite partner to show an outside Ace or King with a bid of 2NT.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< NOTE
We bid 2NT.
