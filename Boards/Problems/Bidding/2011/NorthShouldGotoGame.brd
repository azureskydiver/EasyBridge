Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Clubs.
Partner made an artificial bid of 2 Clubs, showing either a game suit or 20+ points.  We want to respond positively if interested in a slam.
With only 5.0/3.0 points, we deny interest in slam by making the negative response of 2 Diamonds.
We bid 2D.

East passes.

South bids 2H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 2 Clubs, 2 Diamonds, and 2 Hearts.
Partner showed his best suit of Hearts in response to our negative 2D response.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Heart contract...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
But with only 22.5 points in the partnership, we have to pass.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<????????????
We pass.
