Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 6.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0; Total pts = 6.0.
  QT's = 1.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: D

  1 Likely Winners (-1/0/3/-1)
  12 Likely Losers (4/2/2/4)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
South bids 1NT.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 No Trump.
JAC6: With a 5-card minor in Diamonds, and playing only simple transfers, use Jacoby to transfer to 3C by bidding 2 Spades.  We can then rebid 3D at the next opportunity.
We bid 2S.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3NT.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 No Trump, 2 Spades, and 3 No Trump.   <<<<< CLOSE OUT
JC16: Partner replied to our Jacoby transfer with a jump/overcall response of 3 No Trump, indicating max 1NT opening points (17) and 4+ trumps, for a total partnership holding of 23.0-23.0 points and 4+ trumps.
JC18: We instructed partner to bid Clubs last time because we're not playing 4-suit transfers, so we now want to correct to Diamonds.
JC20: With 6.0/6.0/6.0 points in the hand, and a total in the partnership of 23.0-23.0 points, settle for a part score and correct to 4 Diamonds.
We bid 4D.    <<<<<<<<<<<<< NO
