***Bidding restarted***
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
E02: Have 13.0 points in high cards and 2.5 quick tricks, so bid 1 Club.
We bid 1C.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Club and partner's response of 1 Spade.
B3U00: Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid, Spades over Clubs, which shows 5.5-17.5 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
RevV0: We'd like to bid the Heart suit, but we can't reverse with less than 17 points.
RevV2: And since the 3rd best suit (Spades) is not strong enough to bid, we have to rebid the original Club suit.
B3U18a: With poor support for partner's Spade suit (holding Q2), and no other suit available to bid, rebid the Club suit at 2 Clubs.
We bid 2C.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
BXF01: Partner jump rebid his Spade suit at 3 Spades, indicating 11-18 pts.
BXG40: Despite having 5 cards in our preferred Clubs suit and 23.0-30.0 partnership points, we can't push our minor and can't support partner's major, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Spades.  Declarer is South; West leads.
