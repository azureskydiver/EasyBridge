====================
South bids 1S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Spade.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
Partner is showing 12.0-20.0 points and 2+ QT's.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer...
3REVAL8: Since the trump suit is only topped by a Jack, deduct 2 points.
We have 9.0/8.0/8.0 points with poor support for partner's Spade suit (holding 6) and not enough strength for a 2/1 response to show our Diamond suit, so bid 1NT.
We bid 1NT.
--------------------
East bids 2C.
--------------------
South bids 2S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Spade, 1 No Trump, and 2 Spades.
Partner made a minimum rebid of his Spade suit at 2 Spades, showing 12.0-16.0 points and 5+ trump cards.
With 21.0-25.0 HCPs in the partnership and a reasonably balanced hand, though without stoppers in all suits, bid 3 No Trump.   <<<<<<<<<<<????
with only a single trump, we have to escape from partner's Spades and bid 3 No Trump.
We bid 3NT.
