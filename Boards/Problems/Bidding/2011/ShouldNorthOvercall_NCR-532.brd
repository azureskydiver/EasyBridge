S:AJ985  H:9863  D:QJ2  C:K
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 11.0, Distn pts = 2.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.5;
Total pts = 9.5.
  QT's = 1.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  3 Likely Winners (3/-1/1/0)
  10 Likely Losers (2/5/2/1)
Playing five-card majors, Spades can be opened.
Preferred suit is Spades.
====================
West bids 1H.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL3: But we lack the strength with 9.5 pts for a simple overcall.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<????????????
B00: We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2C.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Clubs.
ROVRC5: Partner overcalled at the 2-level, indicating a good 5+ card Club suit, 9.5-14.5 points, and probably 6+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 19.0-24.0 points.
ROVRC99: We have insufficient strength for either a raise, suit shift, or NT bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 Clubs.  Declarer is South; West leads.
