>>>>>>>>>>>> NORTH <<<<<<<<<
S:AKQ3  H:KQ8  D:QT9  C:K94
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 19.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 19.0.
  QT's = 3.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Likely Winners (4/1/0/0)
  8 Likely Losers (0/2/3/3)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Spades.
====================
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
A00: Have 19.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
A10: This exceeds the max pts for a 1NT opening (17), but is less than min pts for 2NT (20).  So bid the lowest openable suit of 1 Club for now, then try for a jump shift to 2NT later.
We bid 1C.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Club and partner's response of 1 Diamond.
B3U00a: Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid after an earlier pass, Diamonds over Clubs, which shows 5.5-11.5 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
4REVAL21: Adjusting by 1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Diamond trump support including a trump honor, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 19.0 to 20.0 points)
B3U74: With less than game-level support for partner's Diamond suit (holding QT9), but with 19.0/19.0/20.0 points and a second suit in Spades (holding AKQ3), show it by jump shifting to 2 Spades.
We bid 2S.
