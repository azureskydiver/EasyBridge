Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Clubs.
ROVRC5: Partner overcalled at the 2-level, indicating a good 5+ card Club suit, 9.5-14.5 points, and probably 6+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 20.5-25.5 points.
ROVRC99: We have insufficient strength for either a raise, suit shift, or NT bid, so pass.
We pass.
