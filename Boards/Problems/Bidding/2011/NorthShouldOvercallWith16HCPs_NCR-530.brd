====================
West bids 1D.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL6a: But we don't have a suit strong enough to overcall with at the 2-level.
B00: We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<NO<<<<<<<<<
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Heart.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Heart suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 23.5-30.5 points.
BN1: With 23.5-30.5 HCPs in the partnership and a reasonably balanced hand, though without stoppers in all suits, bid 2 No Trump.
We bid 2NT.

East passes.
