West overbid hand
>>>>> WEST<<<<
S:A  H:A3  D:AJT86  C:98754
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 13.0, Distn pts = 3.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 13.0.
  QT's = 3.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Likely Winners (1/1/3/0)
  8 Likely Losers (0/1/2/5)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
Opening bid for team.
Have 13.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Diamond.
We bid 1D.
--------------------
North bids 2H.
--------------------
East bids 2S.
--------------------
South bids 4H.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Diamond and partner's response of 2 Spades.
Partner has made a 2 over 1 bid, Spades over Diamonds, which shows 9.0-17.0 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
With weak 1-card support for partner's Spades (holding A) and a decent second suit in Clubs (holding 98754), show it in a 5 Clubs bid.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<??????????  Not at 5 level !!!!
We bid 5C.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South doubles.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 5 Clubs and partner's pass.
Partner passed, showing < 6 points, so with 13.0/13.0 points in hand and 13.0-18.0 total partnership points, we have no choice but to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 5 Clubs (doubled).  Declarer is West; North leads.

We have only 4 sure tricks against a requirement of 11 for the 5C X contract.
The Spade suit looks the most promising for further development.
Checking play sequencing...
We want to work on developing the Spade suit first, so move its plays up to the front if possible.
Interleaving plays...
The tentative list of available plays is as follows:
------>
 Play 1: Ruff a Spade in hand.
 Play 2: Ruff a Spade in hand.
 Play 3: Ruff a Spade in hand.
 Play 4: Lead the Spade Queen from dummy and finesse it, with the Ace in hand as cover.
 Play 5: Cash the Ace of Spades in hand.
 Play 6: Cash the Queen of Spades in dummy.
 Play 7: Ruff a Heart in dummy.
 Play 8: Lead a low Diamond from dummy to finesse the ten in hand against North, with the Ace as cover.
 Play 9: Lead a low Diamond from dummy to finesse the Jack in hand against North, with the Ace as cover.
 Play 10: Play the Ten of Diamonds from hand to force out the opponents' King.
 Play 11: Play the Ten of Diamonds from hand to force out the opponents' Queen.
 Play 12: Play the Ten of Diamonds from hand to force out the opponents' Five.
 Play 13: Cash the Ace of Diamonds in hand.
 Play 14: Cash the Ace of Hearts in hand.
The planning is complete.
