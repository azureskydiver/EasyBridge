====================
South bids 1NT.
--------------------
West bids 3C.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 No Trump.
A10: Partner's bid indicates 15-17 points with balanced hand.
C16: Have 10.0/7.5 points with a 4-card Heart suit (holding JT62), so bid 2 Hearts.
But our bid (2 Hearts) is too low vs. the last bid of of 3 Clubs, so we have to pass.   <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< ????
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 3 Clubs.  Declarer is West; North leads.
