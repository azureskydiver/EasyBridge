BXM11: We have no strong agreement in suits and don't have a very strong suit, but do have 32.0-34.0 points in the partnership, so we want a slam in partner's Diamond suit.
BXM21: And partner has bid a small slam, and with 32.0-34.0 points in the partnership, we're satisfied with the bid, so pass.
We pass.
