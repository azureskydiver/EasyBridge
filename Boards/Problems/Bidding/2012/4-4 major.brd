[[File Comments]]
In this hand I get an interesting result depending on which minor suit I open as South:  (E-W always pass)
 
1.  South 1D, North 1H, South 1S, North 3NT, South pass  (Making 5NT)
 
2.  South 1C, North 1H, South 1S, North 4S, South pass  (Making 6S)
 
In both cases North recognizes the 4-4 Spade fit, but in case 1 North decides to bid 3NT on the basis of his balanced hand with all suits stopped (based on South’s opening 1D).  In case 2 the diamond stopper is much more iffy, so North bids 4S.
 
My experience is that with a 4-4 major fit it is always preferable to play in 4 of a major rather than 3NT.
