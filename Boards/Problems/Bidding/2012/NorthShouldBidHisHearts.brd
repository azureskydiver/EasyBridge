--------------------
B00 Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Spade.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Spade contract...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
F00: Partner is showing 12.0-20.5 points and 2+ QT's.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer for Heart contract...
3REVAL5: Adding 1 point(s) for the 1 extra trump(s).
3REVAL8: Since the trump suit is only topped by a Queen, deduct 1 points.
2REVAL10: (with a 6-card trump suit in Hearts, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 8.0 to 10.0 points)   <<<<<<<<<<  6Hearts!!!
G64: We have 8.0/8.0/8.0 points with poor support for partner's Spade suit (holding 7) and not enough strength for a 2/1 response to show our Heart suit, so bid 1NT.
We bid 1NT.
