[[File Comments]]
The bidding is poor. West made no attemot to find 3N, although in this case 3N was a bad contract.
West should have made a trial bid. Minor suit trial bids are used to find stops.

there are 2 alternatives

1) Minor trial bids show stops. Over 2D West bids 2H, east bids 3C (showing C stop by denying S stop by bypassing 2S) and now west bids 5D.

2) Minor trial bids deny stops (I prefer this.) Over 2D West bids 2S, and East returns to 3D to show that the S stop is missing., or maybe 4D to also show extra strength.   

the opening lead was poor. 
2H or 4D are both better choices. Note taht leading a singleton trump against a 8 card trump fit is not good, because partner will have 4 trumps. But in this case it is very likely from the bidding  that the opponents have 9 or more Diamonds. 
So a 4D lead is much safer, as partner will have 3 or fewer trumps.
