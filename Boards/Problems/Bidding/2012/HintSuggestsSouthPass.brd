Hint suggests south PASS with 15 HCPs
>>>>>>>>SOUTH<<<<<<<<<<<
North bids 1NT.
--------------------
East bids 2S.
--------------------
***Bidding Cancelled***
North bids 1NT.
--------------------
East bids 2S.
--------------------
B00 Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 No Trump.
A10: Partner's bid indicates 15-17 points with balanced hand.
E20: Have 15.0/14.5 points with a 4-card Heart suit (holding QJ96), so bid 2 Hearts. <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
But the bid is too low vs. the last bid of of 2 Spades, so we have to pass.
