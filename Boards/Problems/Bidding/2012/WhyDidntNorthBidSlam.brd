Why didn't North bid slam?
>>>>>>>>>>NORTH<<<<<<<<<<<<
S:AJ9  H:QT98  D:Q6  C:AKQT
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 18.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.0; Total pts = 17.0.
  QT's = 3.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  6 Likely Winners (1/1/0/4)
  7 Likely Losers (2/3/2/0)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
A00: Have 18.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
A10: This exceeds the max pts for a 1NT opening (17), but is less than min pts for 2NT (20).  So bid the lowest openable suit of 1 Club for now, then try for a jump shift to 2NT later.
We bid 1C.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Club and partner's response of 1 Spade.
B3U00: Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid, Spades over Clubs, which shows 5.5-17.5 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Spade contract...
4REVAL21: Adjusting by 0 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Spade trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Diamonds, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 17.0 to 18.0 points)
B3U62: With weak support for partner's Spades (holding AJ9) and a balanced hand with 18.0 HCPs, for a total of 23.5-35.5 HCPs in the partnership, bid 2 No Trump.
We bid 2NT.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 4NT.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
BXPNTI: Partner made an invitational NT Raise to 4 No Trump, inviting us to slam with a maximum.
BXPNTI6: But with a total of only 23.5-35.5 total HCPs, we have to pass on the slam.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 4 No Trump.  Declarer is North; East leads.
