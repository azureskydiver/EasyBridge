CRB20: After our strong 2 Club opening, partner's 3 Clubs bid was a positive response, indicating 7+ pts and 1+ Quick Tricks.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< NO
CRB32: We have strong support for partner's Clubs (holding AKJT), so push towards slam.
BKWDY: Unfortunately, since we hold all four aces, Blackwood is of little value to us.
BKWDY1: so since we have the points for a grand slam, go ahead and bid 7 Clubs.
