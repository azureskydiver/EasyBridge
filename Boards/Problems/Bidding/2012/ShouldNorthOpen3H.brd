Playing five-card majors, Hearts can be opened.
Have a powerful suit in Hearts.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
Opening bid for team.
D04: Have a 7-card Heart suit with no tricks outside the suit, so make a shutout bid of 3 Hearts.
We bid 3H.  <?????????????????????????????????????

Rebidding after opening bid of 3 Hearts and partner's response of 3 No Trump.
NT50: Partner's shift from our 3 Hearts bid to 3 No Trump indicates a balanced hand and 12.0+ points, for a total of 25.0+ points in the partnership.
B3N80: Partner wants to play at 3NT, but with a solid major in Hearts, we prefer to play in the suit, so bid 4 Hearts.
We bid 4H.
