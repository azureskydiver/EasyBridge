====================
South bids 2C.
--------------------
West bids 2H.
--------------------
Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Clubs.
Partner made an artificial bid of 2 Clubs, showing either a game suit or 20+ points.  We want to respond positively if interested in a slam.
With only 4.0/3.0 points, we deny interest in slam by making the negative response of 2 Diamonds.
But our bid (2 Diamonds) is too low vs. the last bid of of 2 Hearts, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 2 Clubs, Pass, and 3 Diamonds.
Partner made a response which we don't understand; simply pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Diamonds.  Declarer is South; West leads.
