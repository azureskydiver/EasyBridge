Why would North Bid NT when he didn't have stoppers in opponents Heart suit?
===================
North analysis
S:A98  H:762  D:QJ75  C:AJ4
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 12.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 12.0.
  QT's = 2.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  2 Likely Winners (0/-1/2/1)
  11 Likely Losers (3/4/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
West bids 1H.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
But we lack the strength with 12.0 pts for a simple overcall.
With 12.0/12.0 points and support for all unbid suits, bid a takeout double.
We bid Dbl.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1S.
--------------------
West doubles.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 2.
Partner has responded in the enemy suit, indicating 13+ pts but no long suits.
The total point count in the partnership is therefore 25.0-34.0 pts.
With 25.0-34.0 HCPs in the partnership and a reasonably balanced hand, though without stoppers in all suits, bid 3 No Trump.
Without clear suit agreement, and holding a blanaced hand, we want to steer towards a contract in No Trump.
We bid 3NT.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 No Trump.  Declarer is North; East leads.
