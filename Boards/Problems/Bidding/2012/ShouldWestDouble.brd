West keeps doubling... forcing East to bid with nothing
=========
S:A53  H:AKT3  D:AQ32  C:K4
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 20.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 20.0.
  QT's = 5.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Likely Winners (0/2/2/1)
  8 Likely Losers (3/2/2/1)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suits are  Diamonds, Hearts
The best suit is Hearts.
====================
North passes.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1C.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
But we don't have a sufficiently strong overcall suit.
With 20.0/20.0 points and support for all unbid suits, bid a takeout double.
We bid Dbl.
--------------------
North bids 1S.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2C.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of Double and partner's pass.
With 20.0/20.0 points and support for all unbid suits, bid a takeout double again.
We bid Dbl.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 2S.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
Partner has made a minimum response of 2 Spades, indicating no more than 9 points.
The total point count in the partnership is therefore 22.0-29.0 pts.
With 22.0-29.0 points in the partnership and 3-card support for partner's major Spade suit (holding A53), raise to 3 Spades.
(we can assume partner has some strength in the Spade suit, so we are shading the requirements slightly.
We bid 3S.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Spades.  Declarer is East; South leads.
