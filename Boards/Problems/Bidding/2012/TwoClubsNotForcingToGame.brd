[[File Comments]]
Even with a bad hand there are some bidding sequences that are forcing.  In this hand South opens 2C, West passes, North bids 2D, East passes, South bids 2H, then all pass.  (North should not pass).
 
Most people play opening 2C sequences as forcing to game unless the opener rebids his suit (or bids 2NT over 2D), in which case responder may pass short of game with a real bust.
