[[File Comments]]
North misses Jacoby 2NT and also ignores South's aggressive bidding and only makes minimal responses -- missing an obvious slem.

North's analysis:
South bids 1S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
B00 Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Spade.
Adjusting by 1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 5-card Spade trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Diamonds, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 11.0 to 16.0 points)
Partner is showing 12.0-21.0 points and 2+ QT's.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer for Spade contract...
2REVAL16: (after re-evaluation for distribution, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 11.0 to 12.0 points)
Have 11.0/11.0/16.0 points with 5-card support for partner's Spades (holding AQJ75), which is too strong for a limit raise, so we have to temporarily shift to Hearts with a bid of 2 Hearts.
We bid 2H.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3C.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Spade, 2 Hearts, and 3 Clubs.
Partner bid another suit (third suit in partnership) at 3 Clubs after our 2/1 response, showing 12.0-18.0 points.
Adjusting by 1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Club trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Diamonds, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 11.0 to 12.0 points)
With 5 trumps in partner's first suit (Spades), we prefer to support that suit.
With 11.0/11.0/12.0 points in hand, for a total in the partnership of 24.0-30.0 points, and 5-card support for partner's first suit (Spades), return to it by shifting back to 3 Spades.
We bid 3S.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 4S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
Partner has reversed from Clubs to Spades.
Without the strength to push further at 24.0-30.0 total team points, pass and accept the contract of 4 Spades.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 4 Spades.  Declarer is South; West leads.
