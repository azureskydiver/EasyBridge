Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 16.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0; Total pts = 16.0.
  QT's = 2.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Likely Winners (3/0/1/1)
  8 Likely Losers (1/3/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Spades.
====================
South bids 3D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
B00 Responding to partner's opening bid of 3 Diamonds.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Diamond contract...
4REVAL21: Adjusting by 1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Diamond trump support including a trump honor, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 16.0 to 17.0 points)
SHUTR0: Partner made a preemptive 3 Diamonds bid, showing a 7-card Diamond suit with no tricks outside the suit, and most likely 5.5-8.5 points.
SHUTR4: We have 16.0/16.0/17.0 points in hand, for a total of 22.5-25.5 points in the partnership, strong support for partner's long Diamond suit (holding KJ7), plus 2.0 QTs and 5 likely winners, so we can safely bid a minor game at 5 Diamonds.
We bid 5D.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<Not enough Aces
--------------------
East passes.

South passes.

West passes.
