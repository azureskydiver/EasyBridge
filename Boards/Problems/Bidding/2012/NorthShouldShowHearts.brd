B00 Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Clubs.
ROVRC5: Partner overcalled at the 2-level, indicating a good 5+ card Club suit, 9.5-14.5 points, and probably 6+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 25.5-30.5 points.
YN1: With 25.5-30.5 points in the partnership and 3-card support for partner's  Club suit (holding AT6), raise to 4 Clubs.
