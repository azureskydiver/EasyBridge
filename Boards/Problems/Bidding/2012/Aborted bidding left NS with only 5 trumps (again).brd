Once again EB as N abandons the bidding early and leaves N-S with only 5 (!) trump cards.  Why not just go to 2NT with zero club support?

Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Club.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Club contract...
3REVAL6: Deducting 6 point(s) for the 3 trump(s) short of 3.
Partner is showing 12.0-19.0 points and 2+ QT's.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer for Heart contract...
3REVAL8: Since the trump suit is only topped by a Queen, deduct 1 points.
2REVAL16: (after re-evaluation for distribution, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 6.0 to 8.0 points)
Have 7.0/6.0/6.0 pts with an available 5-card major suit in Hearts (QT764), so bid 1 Heart over partner's minor suit 1 Club bid.
We bid 1H.

Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Club, 1 Heart, and 2 Clubs.

We pass.
