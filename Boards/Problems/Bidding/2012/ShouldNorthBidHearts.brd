Should North bid Hearts
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>NORTH<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
S:T3  H:KQT9754  D:T643  C:J754
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 5.0, Distn pts = 7.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.0; Total pts = 7.0.
  QT's = 1.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: H
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Likely Winners (0/6/-1/0)
  8 Likely Losers (2/1/5/0)
Playing five-card majors, Hearts can be opened.
Have a strong suit in Hearts.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
West bids 1S.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL3: But we lack the strength with 7.0 pts for a simple overcall.
B00: We cannot overcall and the hand is not appropriate for any other bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 2S.
--------------------
South bids 3D.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
B00 Responding to partner's opening bid of 3 Diamonds.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Diamond contract...
3REVAL5: Adding 1 point(s) for the 1 extra trump(s).
4REVAL21: Adjusting by 0 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 4-card Diamond trump support & a doubleton in Spades,  & a void in Clubs, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 7.0 to 11.0 points)
ROVRC5: Partner overcalled at the 2-level, indicating a good 5+ card Diamond suit, 9.5-14.5 points, and probably 6+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 20.5-25.5 points.
ROVRC20: And although we want to bid our own 7-card Heart suit, we can't bid it at the 3 with only 7.0 points, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Diamonds.  Declarer is South; West leads.
