Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 15.0, Distn pts = 3.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.0; Total pts = 15.0.
  QT's = 2.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Likely Winners (0/0/0/5)
  8 Likely Losers (2/2/3/1)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Have a strong suit in Clubs.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
E01: Have 15.0 points in high cards, so bid 1 Club.
We bid 1C.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1S.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Club and partner's response of 1 Spade.
B3U00: Partner has made a 1 over 1 bid, Spades over Clubs, which shows 5.5-17.5 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Spade contract...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
RevV0: We'd like to bid the Diamond suit, but we can't reverse with less than 17 points.
RevV2: And since the 3rd best suit (Hearts) is not strong enough to bid, we have to rebid the original Club suit.
B3U18a: With poor support for partner's Spade suit (holding QJ), and no other suit available to bid, rebid the Club suit at 2 Clubs.
We bid 2C.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2NT.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
BXPNTA: Partner bid Notrump, indicating a dislike for our Club suit.
BXPNT4: Partner's 2 No Trump bid indicates a preference for NoTrump.
BXPNT5: With a total of 20.5-32.5 / 20.5-32.5 pts in the partnership, we lack adequate strength for a further raise beyond partner's 2 No Trump bid, so we have to pass. <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<???
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 No Trump.  Declarer is South; West leads.
