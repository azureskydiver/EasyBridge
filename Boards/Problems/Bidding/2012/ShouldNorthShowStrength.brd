We bid 1C.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1NT.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Club and partner's response of 1 No Trump.
B3J00: With a 1NT response, partner is showing 5.5-9.5 points, a lack of good support for our Club suit, and no other suit available to bid at an appropriate level.
B3K10: Partner doesn't like our Clubs, but we don't have another suit we can bid, so rebid the suit at 2 Clubs.
We bid 2C.
--------------------
East passes.

South bids 3C.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
RDR0: With a single raise, partner is showing 6.0-10.0 points and decent (3-4 card) support for our Club suit.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer for Club contract...
3REVAL5: Adding 1 point(s) for the 1 extra trump(s).
2REVAL10: (with a 6-card trump suit in Clubs, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 18.0 to 20.0 points)
R27: We have a total of 26.0-30.0 points in the partnership, which is not quite enough for game in a minor suit, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
