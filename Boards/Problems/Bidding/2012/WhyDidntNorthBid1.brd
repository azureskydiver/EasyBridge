Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 13.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.0; Total pts = 12.0.
  QT's = 2.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  2 Likely Winners (2/0/0/0)
  11 Likely Losers (2/3/3/3)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Spades.
====================
West bids 1H.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
OVRCL0: Opponents have opened the bidding; see if we can overcall.
OVRCL3: But we lack the strength with 12.0 pts for a simple overcall.
TKOUT: With 13.0/12.0 points and support for all unbid suits, bid a takeout double.
We bid Dbl.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 1S.
--------------------
West doubles.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 2.
TKORb43: Partner has made a minimum response of 1 Spade, indicating no more than 9 points.
TKRb49: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 14.0-21.0 pts.
TKRb72: With a total of 14.0-21.0 points in the partnership, we have insufficient strength to raise partner's 1 Spade bid, so we have to pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 2D.
