  QT's = 3.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: D, C

Playing five-card majors, Hearts can be opened.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
Opening bid for team.
E02: Have 13.0 points in high cards and 3.0 quick tricks, so bid 1 Heart.
We bid 1H.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 3H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Heart and partner's response of 3 Hearts.
S00: With a double raise and playing limit raises, partner is showing 10.0-12.0 points and 4+ card support for our Heart suit.  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<< 4 cards????????????
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer for Heart contract...
3REVAL8: Since the trump suit is only topped by a ten, deduct 3 points.
2REVAL18: Declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract in Hearts from 13.0 down to 11.0 points)
S11: We have 21.0-23.0 total points in the partnership, which is insufficient for a higher contract than the 3 Hearts bid by partner, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Hearts.  Declarer is North; East leads.
