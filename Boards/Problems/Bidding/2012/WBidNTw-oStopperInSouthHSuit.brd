West bid NT over South's bid of 1H without stoppers.. is that wise?
==================
West analysis
S:K98  H:98  D:J96  C:A8763
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 8.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-0.5;
Total pts = 7.5.
  QT's = 1.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  2 Likely Winners (0/0/0/2)
  11 Likely Losers (3/2/3/3)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
Opening bid for team.
Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 1D.
--------------------
South bids 1H.
--------------------
B00 Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Diamond.
Adjusting by 1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Diamond trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Hearts, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 7.5 to 10.0 points)
Partner, opening in third position, is showing 10.0-19.5 points and 2+ QT's.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer for Club contract...
2REVAL16: (after re-evaluation for distribution, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 7.5 to 8.5 points)
We have 8.0/7.5/10.0 points with weak support for partner's minor Diamond suit (holding J96) which we prefer not to raise, and not enough strength for a 2/1 response to show our Club suit, so bid 1NT.
We bid 1NT.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 2D.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Diamond, 1 No Trump, and 2 Diamonds.
Partner made a minimum rebid of his Diamond suit at 2 Diamonds, showing 10.0-16.0 points and 5+ trump cards.
with a total of 20.0-26.0 pts in the partnership and no clear direction in the bidding, pass.
We pass.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 Diamonds.  Declarer is East; South leads.
