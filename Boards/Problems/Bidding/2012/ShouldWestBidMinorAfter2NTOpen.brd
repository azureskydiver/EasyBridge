Qhy would West bid clubs.. a minor.. vs hearts?
============
S:J42  H:QT843  D:T965  C:KT873
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 6.0, Distn pts = 3.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-1.5;
Total pts = 4.5.
  QT's = 0.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: H, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  4 Likely Winners (0/2/0/2)
  9 Likely Losers (3/3/0/3)
Playing five-card majors, Hearts can be opened.
Preferred suit is Clubs.
====================
East bids 2NT.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
B00 Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 No Trump.
Partner's bid indicates 22-24 points with balanced hand.
Have 6.0/4.5 points with a 5-card minor Club suit, so bid3 Clubs.
We bid 3C.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Clubs.  Declarer is West; North leads.
=======================
Playing card from dummy.
Combined hand (Dummy/Hand):
  S:AJ8742 (A87/J42)
  H:AQJT98643 (AJ96/QT843)
  D:AQ5 (AQ5/)
  C:AKQJT873 (AQJ/KT873)
Combined hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 28.0, Distn pts = 3.0;
  Total pts = 31.0.
  QT's = 6.0,
  Stoppers in: S, H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  8 Sure Winners (1/1/1/5)
  11 Eventual Winners (1/4/1/5)
  2 Possible Losers (vs. 4 allowable)
Dummy's hand has been laid down; now planning the play with a contract of 3 Clubs.
---------------------------
Planning the play...
Combined hand (Dummy/Hand):
  S:AJ8742 (A87/J42)
  H:AQJT98643 (AJ96/QT843)
  D:AQ5 (AQ5/)
  C:AKQJT873 (AQJ/KT873)
Combined hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 28.0, Distn pts = 3.0;
  Total pts = 31.0.
  QT's = 6.0,
  Stoppers in: S, H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  8 Sure Winners (1/1/1/5)
  11 Eventual Winners (1/4/1/5)
  2 Possible Losers (vs. 4 allowable)
We have 11 sure tricks against a requirement of 9 for the 3C contract.
The Heart suit looks the most promising for further development.
Checking play sequencing...
We want to work on developing the Heart suit first, so move its plays up to the front if possible.
Interleaving plays...
The tentative list of available plays is as follows:
------>
 Play 1: Pull a round of trumps with the Ace in dummy.
 Play 2: Pull a round of trumps with the Queen in dummy.
 Play 3: Pull a round of trumps with the Jack in dummy.
 Play 4: Pull a round of trumps with the King in hand if necessary.
 Play 5: Pull a round of trumps with the ten in hand if necessary.
 Play 6: Lead a low Heart from hand to finesse the nine in dummy against South, with the Ace as cover.
 Play 7: Lead a low Heart from hand to finesse the Jack in dummy against South, with the Ace as cover.
 Play 8: Lead the Heart Queen from hand and finesse it, with the Ace in dummy as cover.
 Play 9: Play the Queen of Hearts from hand to force out the opponents' King.
 Play 10: Cash the Ace of Hearts in dummy.
 Play 11: Ruff a Diamond in hand.
 Play 12: Ruff a Diamond in hand.
 Play 13: Cash the Ace of Diamonds in dummy.
 Play 14: Cash the Ace of Spades in dummy.
 Play 15: Cash the Ace of Clubs in dummy.
 Play 16: Cash the Queen of Clubs in dummy.
 Play 17: Cash the Jack of Clubs in dummy.
 Play 18: Cash the King of Clubs in hand.
 Play 19: Cash the Ten of Clubs in hand.
The planning is complete.
---------------------------
The opponents led a Spade, so cash the Ace now.
East analysis: 
====================
S:A87  H:AJ96  D:AQ5  C:AQJ
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 22.0, Distn pts = 0.0, Bonus/Penalty = 1.0/0.0;
Total pts = 23.0.
  QT's = 5.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  5 Likely Winners (0/2/1/2)
  8 Likely Losers (3/2/2/1)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================
Opening bid for team.
Have 22.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
This meets the rqmts for a 2NT opening (22-24), so bid 2NT.
We bid 2NT.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West bids 3C.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 2 No Trump and partner's response of 3 Clubs.
Partner made a response which we don't understand; simply pass.
We pass.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 3 Clubs.  Declarer is West; North leads.
