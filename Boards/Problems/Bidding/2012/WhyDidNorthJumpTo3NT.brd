Why did North bid 3NT
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<NORTH<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
S:AKQ  H:64  D:KQ986  C:A74
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 18.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0; Total pts = 18.0.
  QT's = 4.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  6 Likely Winners (3/0/3/0)
  7 Likely Losers (0/2/2/3)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
East passes.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
A00: Have 18.0 HCP's with a balanced hand.
A10: This exceeds the max pts for a 1NT opening (17), but is less than min pts for 2NT (20).  So bid the lowest openable suit of 1 Diamond for now, then try for a jump shift to 2NT later.
We bid 1D.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
South bids 2C.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Diamond and partner's response of 2 Clubs.
B3W00a: Partner has made a 2 over 1 bid following an earlier pass, Clubs over Diamonds, which shows 9.5-11.5 points and is forcing for one round.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Club contract...
4REVAL21: Adjusting by 1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Club trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Hearts, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 18.0 to 19.0 points)
B3W59: With weak support for partner's Clubs (holding A74) and no good second suit, we have show our strength by jump shifting in Notrumps to 3 No Trump, despite the unbalanced hand.
We bid 3NT.  ??????????????????????<<<<<<<<<<<<<< Close out bid!!!
