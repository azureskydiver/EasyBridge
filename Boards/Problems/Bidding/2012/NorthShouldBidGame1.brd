RWKT: Partner made a weak 2-bid, showing a a 6+ card suit with 5.5-10.5 points, less than 4 cards in the other major, no voids, and no more than one singleton.
RWKT15: We have 15.0/15.0/15.0 points, for a partnership total of 20.5-25.5 points, so we are interested in game if a good fit can be found.
RWKT21: And we like partner's Spade suit (holding AT8762 support), but with only 20.5-25.5 total pts we don't quite have enough for a direct game bid, so invite partner to show an outside Ace or King with a bid of 2NT.
