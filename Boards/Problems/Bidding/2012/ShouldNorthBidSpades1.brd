3REVAL5: Adding 3 point(s) for the 2 extra trump(s).
3REVAL8: Since the trump suit is only topped by a Queen, deduct 1 points.
2REVAL10: (with a 7-card trump suit in Spades, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 4.0 to 9.0 points)
F01a: Have 5.0/4.0/4.0 pts with an available 7-card major suit in Spades (QJT7532), so bid 1 Spade over partner's minor suit 1 Diamond bid.

B4E10: With only 5.0/4.0 pts in hand, for a total in the partnership of approx. 16.0-24.5 HCPs, making a game seems unlikely, so pass.
