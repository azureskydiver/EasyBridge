[[File Comments]]
1) Playing 4 card majors with a weak 1NT, North should have opened 1 NT, 

2) I raised 1H to 2H. If East had passed this shows 6 - 10 points. As East has interfered, many player would argue that this could be weaker.
But despite only 12 points, 4 hearts, wasted points in a short suit, and a balanced hand, North makes an invitational raise. The maximum we could have is
22 points.
North should pass.
