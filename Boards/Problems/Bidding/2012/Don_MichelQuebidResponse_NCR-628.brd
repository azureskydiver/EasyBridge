My wife played this hand in EasyBridge and it looked to her like the perfect situation for Michaels.  West opened 1S and being 5-5 in hearts and clubs she bid 2S as South (I later pointed out that with 13 HCP, a takeout double or overcall is preferred).  Imagine her surprise when North passed !  According to North’s analysis he recognized the 2S bid as Michaels, but he thought he was too weak to bid on the 3 level.  With 4 hearts to the ace, he must bid 3 hearts instead of pass (even with only 5 HCP).  Note that a 3H contract would make.
