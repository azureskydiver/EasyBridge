Total pts = 12.0.

  8 Likely Losers (3/1/3/1)
Playing five-card majors, Spades can be opened.

South bids 2C.

West passes.
--------------------
B00 Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Clubs.
Partner made a strong 2-bid, showing a very good suit or two solid suits, 9+ playing tricks, and 4+ quick tricks.  We have to respond positively if interested in slam, or negatively otherwise.
We have 2.5 QT's, so we can make a positive response.
But unfortunately we have poor support for partner's Club suit (holding 2), no good suit of our own, and an unbalanced hand, so we have to make the negative response of 2 No Trump.
We bid 2NT.

East passes.

REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Club contract...
3REVAL6: Deducting 4 point(s) for the 2 trump(s) short of 3.
Partner is showing 12.0-19.5 points and 2+ QT's.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer for Heart contract...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 5.
Have 12.0/12.0/12.0 pts with an available 4-card major suit in Hearts (AQJ9), so bid 1 Heart over partner's minor suit 1 Club bid.
We bid 1H.

Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Club, 1 Heart, and 3 Diamonds.
With 3 trumps in partner's second suit (Diamonds), we prefer to support that suit.
Partner made a jump shift to 3 Diamonds in response to our 1 Heart bid, showing 19.0-22.0 points.  The bid is forcing to game.
Adjusting by 1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Diamond trump support including a trump honor & a singleton in Clubs, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 12.0 to 15.0 points)
with 12.0/12.0/15.0 points in the hand, for a total of approx. 31.0-34.0 / 34.0-37.0 pts in the partnership, explore slam possibilities with Blackwood at 4 No Trump. The eventual contract in Diamond.
We pick Diamonds for the ultimate slam contract suit.
We bid 4NT.

South bids 5D.

Rebidding in round 3.
Partner responded to our 4NT Blackwood inquiry with 5 Diamonds, indicating 1 Ace.
Without all four aces we can't proceed to a grand slam, so stop at Pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 5 Diamonds.  Declarer is South; West leads.
