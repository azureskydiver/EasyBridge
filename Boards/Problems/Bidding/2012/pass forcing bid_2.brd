Here West is the culprit.  After opening 1D on 13 HCP, he passes East’s forcing response of 2C. 
 Again, because the partnership HCP total is only 23 to 31 points !
Another pass of forcing bid.

West's analysis:

S:Q752  H:AQ  D:K632  C:QT3
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 13.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0; Total pts = 13.0.
  QT's = 2.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  3 Likely Winners (1/1/1/0)
  10 Likely Losers (3/1/3/3)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suits are  Diamonds, Spades
The best suit is Diamonds.
====================
***Bidding restarted***
Opening bid for team.
Have 13.0 points in high cards and 2.0 quick tricks, so bid 1 Diamond.
We bid 1D.
--------------------
North passes.
--------------------
East bids 2C.
--------------------
South passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 1 Diamond and partner's response of 2 Clubs.
Partner has made a 2 over 1 bid, Clubs over Diamonds, which shows 10.0-18.0 points and is forcing for one round.
Adjusting by 1 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Club trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Hearts, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 13.0 to 14.0 points)
But with only about 23.0-31.0 HCPS in the partnership, we don't have enough for game, so pass.
We pass.

North passes.

Bidding finished; contract is 2 Clubs.  Declarer is East; South leads.
