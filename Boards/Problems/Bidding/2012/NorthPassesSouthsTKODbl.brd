Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.

East bids 3H.
--------------------
South doubles.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
A10: Responding to partner's opening double.
TKOTR: Partner has doubled for takeout.
TKOTR8: Partner's takeout indicates 12.5+ HCPs, for a total in the partnership of 22.5-31.5 points.
TKOTR33: With 10.0 HCPs and a balanced hand, respond with a bid of 2 No Trump.
But our bid (2 No Trump) is too low vs. the last bid of of 3 Hearts, so we have to pass.
We pass.
