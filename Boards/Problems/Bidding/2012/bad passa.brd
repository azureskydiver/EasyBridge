North should NOT pass 2NT!

North's bidding analysis:

S:T876  H:AQT94  D:Q8  C:Q5
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 10.0, Distn pts = 2.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/-2.0;
Total pts = 8.0.
  QT's = 1.5,
  Sure Stoppers in: H
  Probable Stoppers in:
  2 Likely Winners (-1/3/0/0)
  11 Likely Losers (5/2/2/2)
Playing five-card majors, Hearts can be opened.
Preferred suit is Hearts.
====================

South bids 1D.

B00 Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Diamond.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Diamond contract...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
Partner is showing 12.0-21.0 points and 2+ QT's.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer for Heart contract...
2REVAL16: (after re-evaluation for distribution, declarer's hand is revalued for a suit contract from 8.0 to 10.0 points)
Have 10.0/8.0/8.0 pts with an available 5-card major suit in Hearts (AQT94), so bid 1 Heart over partner's minor suit 1 Diamond bid.
We bid 1H.

South bids 2NT.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 1 Diamond, 1 Heart, and 2 No Trump.
Partner's jump shift from our 1 Heart bid to 2 No Trump indicates a balanced hand and 17.0+ points, for a total of 25.0+ points in the partnership, and is forcing to game.
with 10.0/8.0 points in hand, and a total of 25.0-27.0 in the partnership, sign off on partner's contract of 2NT.
We pass.
--------------------
East passes.
--------------------
Bidding finished; contract is 2 No Trump.  Declarer is South; West leads.
=======================


The N/S bidding went S: 1D N: 1H, S: 2NT (the hand really is not balanced enough for for me to bid 2NT, but I did anyway – 2 doubletons makes it unbalanced) N: pass!
 
North’s own analysis says 2NT is forcing to game but he passes anyway with 8 HCP.
 
By the way my point count ranges for balanced and semi-balanced (5 card minor allowed) hand opening bids are:
 
13-14 Open 1 of a minor, rebid NT (non-jump)
15-17 Open 1NT
18-19 Open 1 of a minor, jump rebid NT
20-21 Open 2NT
22-23 Open 2C, rebid 2NT
24+ Open 2C, jump in NT
 
I had assumed that in EasyBridge that if I set point count of 15-17 for 1NT and 20-21 for 2NT that it would use the same schedule that I listed above.  However, in North’s analysis of South’s 2NT, he indicates 17+ points (instead of 18-19).  Now, maybe I’m quibbling because 1 point isn’t much, but it means North passed 2NT with a combined point count of 26-27  -- clearly enough for game, especially with a 5 card heart suit and an honor in my suit.
