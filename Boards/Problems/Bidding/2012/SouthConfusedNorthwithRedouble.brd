====================
West passes.
--------------------
Opening bid for team.
Z00: Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East bids 1D.
--------------------
South bids 1H.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
B00 Responding to partner's opening bid of 1 Heart.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Heart contract...
4REVAL21: Adjusting by 0 point(s) for bonus points and 0 points for penalty.
2REVAL38: (with 3-card Heart trump support including a trump honor & a doubleton in Spades, the hand is revalued for a suit contract as dummy from 8.5 to 9.5 points)
ROVRC1: Partner overcalled at the 1-level, indicating a good 5+ card Heart suit, 8-15 points, and probably 5+ playing tricks.
ROVRC8: The total point count in the partnership is therefore 17.0-24.0 points.
ROVRC99: We have insufficient strength for either a raise, suit shift, or NT bid, so pass.
We pass.
--------------------
East doubles.
--------------------
South redoubles.
--------------------
West passes.
--------------------
B00 Responding to partner's  bid of Redouble.
F01: Partner, opening in fourth position, is showing 10.0-20.5 points and 2+ QT's.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as declarer for Club contract...
3REVAL8: Since the trump suit is only topped by a Queen, deduct 1 points.
G68: We have 9.0/8.5/8.5 points with N/A support for partner's ???? suit (holding ) and no good major of our own, so bid 1NT.
We bid 1NT.
--------------------
East passes.
