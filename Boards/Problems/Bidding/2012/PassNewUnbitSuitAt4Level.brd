Shouldn't stay in new unbit suit, I suspect.. but haven't seen it lay down...
West analysis
++++++++++++++++++++
S:QT43  H:Q98  D:A842  C:98
Hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 8.0, Distn pts = 1.0, Bonus/Penalty = 0.0/0.0;
Total pts = 8.0.
  QT's = 1.0,
  Sure Stoppers in: S, H, D
  Probable Stoppers in:
  2 Likely Winners (1/0/1/0)
  11 Likely Losers (3/3/3/2)
Playing five-card majors, neither major suit qualifies for opening.
Preferred suit is Diamonds.
====================
Opening bid for team.
Hand is insufficient for any opening, so pass.
We pass.

B00 Responding to partner's opening bid of 2 Clubs.
Partner made a strong 2-bid, showing a very good suit or two solid suits, 9+ playing tricks, and 4+ quick tricks.  We have to respond positively if interested in slam, or negatively otherwise.
We have 1.0 QT's, so we can make a positive response.
But we lack good support for partner's Club suit (holding 98) with a balanced hand, so jump to 3 No Trump.
We bid 3NT.
--------------------
North passes.

East bids 4C.

South passes.
--------------------
Rebidding as responder after bids of 2 Clubs, 3 No Trump, and 4 Clubs.
Partner made a minimum rebid of his Club suit at 4 Clubs after his initial strong 2 Clubs opening, showing 21.0+ points and 5+ trump cards.
REVAL1: Revaluing hand as dummy for Club contract...
3REVAL6: Deducting 2 point(s) for the 1 trump(s) short of 3.
With 29.0-29.0 points in the partnership, we want to explore slam opportunities.
Rebid the best suit of Diamonds in a bid of 4 Diamonds.
We have 8.0/8.0 pts in hand and 29.0-29.0 pts in the partnership, but have no good fit with partner and no rebiddable suit, so we have no choice but to shift to yet another suit.
We bid 4D.

Dummy's hand has been laid down; now planning the play with a contract of 4 Diamonds.

Planning the play...
Combined hand (Dummy/Hand):
  S:AQJT743 (AJ7/QT43)
  H:AQ983 (A3/Q98)
  D:AK8542 (K5/A842)
  C:AKQ98652 (AKQ652/98)
Combined hand evaluation:
  HCPs = 29.0, Distn pts = 4.0;
  Total pts = 33.0.
  QT's = 7.0,
  Stoppers in: S, H, D, C
  Probable Stoppers in:
  7 Sure Winners (1/1/2/3)
  9 Eventual Winners (3/1/2/3)
  4 Possible Losers (vs. 3 allowable)
We have only 9 sure tricks against a requirement of 10 for the 4D contract.
The Club suit looks the most promising for further development.
Checking play sequencing...
We want to work on developing the Club suit first, so move its plays up to the front if possible.
Interleaving plays...
The tentative list of available plays is as follows:
------>
 Play 1: Pull a round of trumps with the King in dummy.
 Play 2: Play the CA from Dummy to try and drop one or more of the { CJ CT  }.
 Play 3: Play the CK from Dummy to try and drop one or more of the { CJ CT  }.
 Play 4: Ruff a Club in hand.
 Play 5: Ruff a Club in hand.
 Play 6: Cash the Ace of Clubs in dummy.
 Play 7: Cash the King of Clubs in dummy.
 Play 8: Cash the Queen of Clubs in dummy.
 Play 9: Ruff a Spade in dummy.
 Play 10: Ruff a Heart in dummy.
 Play 11: Lead a low Spade from hand to finesse the Jack in dummy against South, with the Ace as cover.
 Play 12: Lead the Spade Queen from hand and finesse it, with the Ace in dummy as cover.
 Play 13: Play the Queen of Spades from hand to force out the opponents' King.
 Play 14: Cash the Ace of Hearts in dummy.
 Play 15: Cash the Ace of Spades in dummy.
 Play 16: Cash the King of Diamonds in dummy.
 Play 17: Cash the Ace of Diamonds in hand.
The planning is complete.
---------------------------
The opponents led a Heart, so cash the Ace now.

North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding after opening bid of 2 Clubs and partner's response of 3 No Trump.
After our strong 2 Clubs opening bid, partner's 3 No Trump bid was a positive response, indicating 1+ Quick Tricks.
But we don't like partner's No Trump suit (holding ), so bid our own Clubs suit at 4 Clubs.
We bid 4C.

South passes.
--------------------
West bids 4D.

North passes.
--------------------
Rebidding in round 3.
